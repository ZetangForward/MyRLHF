       "{'prompt': 'Answer the question based on the given passages.\\n\\nThe following are given passages.\\nA team led by Alan Hemming, MD, transplant surgeon at UC San Diego Health System, has successfully performed the west coast\\'s first ex-vivo liver resection, a radical procedure to completely remove and reconstruct a diseased liver and re-implant it without any tumors. The procedure saved the life of a 27-year old mother whose liver had been invaded by a painful tumor that crushed the organ and entangled its blood supply.\\n\"During a 9-hour surgery the team was able to remove the basketball-sized tumor,\" said Hemming, professor and surgical director of the Center for Hepatobiliary Disease and Abdominal Transplantation (CHAT) at UC San Diego Health System. \"This is a surgery that carries a 15 to 20 percent risk of mortality. In this case, the patient would not have survived if she did not have surgery. This was the only way we could save her liver and her life.\"\\nDuring the procedure, the diseased liver was detached from the body, flushed with preservation solution and cooled to a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius. This allowed Hemming to carefully remove the tumor from the liver in a bloodless field while preserving vital structures. Hemming then removed the tumor which weighed as much as the liver itself. Once the tumor was removed, the vessels were meticulously reconstructed. The liver was then successfully reimplanted.\\n\"It was amazing to learn the tumor was so big and growing inside me,\" said Clerisa Keirsey, mother of three and Oceanside resident. \"I am glad Dr. Hemming was here to perform the surgery and happy to be going home to be with my children.\"\\nHemming specializes in all forms of liver surgery including split, living-related, and domino transplant procedures and has performed more than 700 liver transplants and 900 liver resections. He performs all aspects of hepatobiliary surgery including both open and laparoscopic liver resection for tumors, resection of the pancreas and bile duct, and portal decompressive procedures.\\nThe Center for Hepatobiliary Disease and Abdominal Transplantation at UC San Diego Health System offers full spectrum liver care, from diagnostics and testing to novel therapies and clinical trials not found anywhere else in the United States.\\nThe CHAT team includes: Robert Gish, MD, Alan Hemming, MD, Ajai Khanna, MD, Yuko Kono, MD, Alexander Kuo, MD, Rohit Loomba, MD, Kristin Mekeel, MD, Michel Mendler, MD, Heather Patton, MD, and Rene Pink, RN.\\nA study published in the\\n\"This study proves that transplant is an effective treatment to improve quality of life and survival for patients with colorectal cancer that metastasized to the liver,\" said senior study author Dr. Gonzalo Sapisochin, a transplant surgeon at the Ajmera Transplant Centre and the Sprott Department of Surgery at University Health Network (UHN).\\n\"As the first successful North American experience, it represents an important step towards moving this protocol from the research arena to standard of care,\" adds Dr. Sapisochin, who is also a clinician investigator at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at University of Toronto.\\nThe study, which was conducted at UHN, the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), and the Cleveland Clinic, focused on colorectal cancer in part because of its tendency to spread to the liver. Nearly half of all patients with colorectal cancer develop liver metastases within a few years of diagnosis and 70 percent of liver tumors in these patients cannot be removed without removing the entire liver.\\nUnfortunately, deceased-donor liver transplant is not a viable option for most of these patients because, despite their tumors, their liver function is fairly normal, which lands them toward the bottom of the national organ transplant waiting list. In North America, one in six patients dies each year while waiting for an organ on this list.\\nThanks to recent advances in cancer treatments, many of these patients are able to get their cancer under systemic control, which means their liver tumors are the only things standing between them and a \"cancer free\" label. It also increases the odds that these patients -- and their new livers -- will remain cancer free, which is crucial when balancing the benefit to the patient with the risk to a living donor.\\n\"I\\'ve seen so many cancer patients, whose cancers were not spreading, but we couldn\\'t remove the tumors from their livers and we knew they would die,\" said first study author Dr. Roberto Hernandez-Alejandro, who is chief of the Abdominal Transplant and Liver Surgery Division at URMC. \"We hoped living-donor liver transplant could give them another chance.\"\\nBecause it offered a last resort, the study attracted patients from near and far. All patients and donors went through a rigorous screening process to ensure they were good candidates for the procedure, and they were educated about the risks of the surgery and the possibility of cancer recurrence.\\nPatients and donors underwent staggered surgeries to fully remove patients\\' diseased livers and replace them with half of their donors\\' livers. Over time, both patients\\' and donors\\' livers regenerate and regain normal function.\\nPatients have been closely monitored via imaging and blood analysis for any signs of cancer recurrence and will continue to be followed for up to five years after their surgery. At the time the study was published, two patients had follow-up of two or more years and both remained alive and well, cancer-free.\\n\"This [study] brings hope for patients who have a dismal chance of surviving a few more months,\" said Dr. Hernandez-Alejandro, who is also an investigator at the Wilmot Cancer Institute. \"With this, we\\'re opening opportunities for patients to live longer -- and for some of them, to be cured.\"\\n\"We have seen very good outcomes with this protocol, with 100 percent survival and 62 percent of patients remaining cancer free one year and a half after surgery,\" said study author Dr. Mark Cattral, surgical director of the Living Donor Liver Program at UHN\\'s Ajmera Transplant Centre and a surgeon in the Sprott Department of Surgery at UHN. \"It is very strong data to support that we can offer this treatment safely and make appropriate use of scarce life-saving organs.\"\\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\\nThis work was supported by generous donors to UHN Foundation.\\nCancer incidence is higher among liver transplant recipients in Finland compared to the general population, according to a new study in the October issue of Liver Transplantation.\\nTransplantation, and subsequent immunosuppression which keeps rejection at bay, have long been associated with increased cancer risk. Several studies have examined the issue, but few have used a control population for comparison, and many rely on limited data. More studies are needed to reliably reveal the cancer risk pattern after transplantation, so doctors can optimize immunosuppression, cancer surveillance and risk management.\\nResearchers, led by Helena Isoniemi of Finland , sought to describe the cancer risk pattern in Finnish liver transplant patients, hypothesizing that the incidence of specific types of cancer would be higher among the recipients. They included all liver transplant patients from Helsinki University Central Hospital transplanted between 1982 and 2005. Using the Finnish Population Register and the national Cancer Registry, they were able to follow-up on each patient beginning at the date of transplant through the end of 2005.\\nAmong the 540 liver transplant recipients, they found a total of 39 post-transplant de novo cancers in 36 patients. The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) compared to the general population was 2.59. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma had significantly elevated SIRs.\\n\"The most common cancer types in our cohort were lymphoma and skin cancer,\" the authors report. \"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which included four cases of post-transplant lymphoproliverative disorder, occurred more frequently in males, in patients transplanted at a younger age and soon after transplantation.\" By contrast, non-melanoma skin cancer was more common among older patients and those who had antibody induction therapy. Interestingly, the authors found lower cancer incidence among patients with history of acute rejections, correlating most strongly with lymphomas.\\n\"Based on our data, one out of six liver transplant patients is estimated to develop some form of cancer by 20 years after transplantation.\" The authors report. \"This study points out the importance of cancer surveillance after liver transplantation.\"\\nAn accompanying editorial by Ashokkumar Jain of the University of Rochester et. al. reviews the Aberg et al findings alongside the rest of the literature, looking closely at patient age and duration of follow-up. Aberg and colleagues \"show that the cumulative incidence of de novo cancers increased at 1, 5, 10 and 20 years of follow up from 3 percent, 5 percent, 13 percent and 16 percent respectively,\" Jain writes.\\nHe also pointed out that other reports have noted a significantly increased risk of de novo oropharyngeal and lung cancers amongst liver transplant patients that smoke, which is a potentially preventable condition.\\nThroughout the literature, Jain and his coauthors found wide variation in the reported incidence of post transplant cancers, partly related to the length of follow up and partly related to the inclusion or exclusion of lymphoid lesions.\\n\"The overall rate of de novo solid tumors increased with age at the time of transplant and the length of follow up; while the rate of post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders decreased with age at the liver transplant, with a higher incidence in the first few years,\" they conclude.\\nResearchers who investigated the level of kidney function and subsequent cancer risk in more than one million adults have found that reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) -- a key measure of reduced kidney function and chronic kidney disease (CKD) -- is an independent risk factor for renal and urothelial cancer but not other cancer types.\\nThe retrospective study of almost 1.2 million adult members of the Kaiser Permanente healthcare system was conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, the University of Utah\\'s Huntsman Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and published online in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.\\nChronic kidney disease and cancer are both major and growing public health problems. The incidence of chronic kidney disease continues to rise, with an estimated 11.5 percent of the U.S. population having reduced glomerular filtration rate, and approximately 13.5 million Americans with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease.\\n\"While multiple studies have observed higher risks of cancer in persons with end-stage renal disease, the association of less severe kidney disease with cancer remains poorly understood,\" said lead author William Lowrance, MD, MPH, investigator at the University of Utah\\'s Huntsman Cancer Institute. \"These findings address that knowledge gap.\"\\nInvestigators studied 1,190,538 adults aged 40 years and older with known kidney function and no history of cancer, dialysis or renal transplantation. Median follow-up of the cohort between 2000 and 2008 was 5.3 years. At their entry point to the study, patients with lower GFR were more likely to be older, be persons of color, be current or former smokers, have lower socioeconomic status, and have a higher burden of comorbidity.\\nDuring follow-up, a total of 76,809 incident cancers were documented among 72,875 subjects (38,744 men and 34,131 women). Compared with GFR (in ml/min/1.73 m2) of 60 to 89, there was an increased rate of incident renal cancer, ranging from a 39 percent increased rate for GFR of 45 to 59 to a more than two-fold increased rate for GFR less than 30. This increased rate was of greater magnitude for clear cell renal cancer as compared with non-clear cell renal cancer.\\nCompared with GFR of 60 to 89, researchers also found that GFR less than 30 was associated with a 48 percent increased rate of urothelial cancer. However, GFR levels below 60 were not significantly associated with prostate, colorectal, lung, breast or any cancer.\\nThe researchers say several possible biologic mechanisms may help to explain the association between level of kidney function and renal or urothelial cancers. Kidney dysfunction results in a state of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, and such an inflammatory microenvironment may play a role in cancer development. Severe chronic kidney disease may additionally create a relative state of immunodeficiency, which could influence the development of cancer.\\n\"These and other mechanisms deserve further study in order to better define the link between kidney function and site-specific cancer risk,\" said Paul Russo, MD, FACS, study co-author and urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering. \"The stronger association of GFR and clear cell renal cancer as compared with non-clear cell provides new insights into the biologic underpinnings of the association of chronic kidney disease and renal cancer.\"\\nAs for the clinical implications of the findings, Juan Ordonez, MD, study co-author and Chair of the Chiefs of Nephrology for Kaiser Permanente Northern California, said, \"If GFR is associated with an increased risk of renal and urothelial cancer, then it could have implications for directing cancer screening efforts in select populations. Currently, there are no evidence-based cancer screening recommendations tailored for patients with chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are needed to clarify the reasons for this association and help us assess the potential advantage of targeted cancer screening in patients with chronic kidney disease.\"\\nA new study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium found that chronic kidney disease and its complications were associated with a higher risk of death regardless of age. The findings were presented October 30 at the American Society of Nephrology conference in San Diego, Ca. and published in latest issue of\\nChronic kidney disease prevalence increases dramatically with age from 4 percent at age 20-39 to 54 percent of adults over age 75 in the populations studied. This led some groups to question whether kidney disease at older ages is associated with increased risk and even whether the accepted definition of chronic kidney disease should be changed. Kidney disease is measured by estimating kidney function (glomerular filtration rate, GFR), and kidney damage is often quantified by measuring albumin, the major protein in the urine standardized for urine concentration.\\nAccording to the study, both low kidney function and high albuminuria were independently associated with mortality and end-stage renal disease regardless of age. Among the general populations examined and groups at high risk for kidney disease, the study found that relative mortality risk decreased with age in participants with low kidney function while absolute excess risk increased. For participants with high albuminuria, the reductions in relative risk were less apparent while increases in absolute risk were higher among older participants.\\n\"By collaborating with many of the world\\'s leading studies, we were able to see a clear pattern showing that both of the current indicators of chronic kidney disease are strongly associated with risk, even at older age,\" said Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, MHS, the Consortium\\'s principal investigator and professor in the Bloomberg School\\'s Department of Epidemiology.\\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 2 million participants from 46 cohort studies conducted during 1972 to 2011. The study participants included a diverse population from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. Stein Hallan, a nephrologist from Norway, who led the writing of the manuscript on behalf of the 178 collaborating investigators said, \"This analysis put to bed the controversy about kidney disease among older adults and the hypothesis that chronic kidney disease is so common at old age that it must be \\'normal.\\' Instead we need to focus on the range of risks at each age and potential strategies to help patients minimize unnecessary exposure to medications toxic to the kidney and pursue other strategies to best treat kidney disease across the full age spectrum.\"\\n\"Age and the Association of Kidney Measures with Mortality and End-Stage Renal Disease\" written by the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC), which includes approximately 200 collaborators and data from 40 countries.\\nThe U.S. National Kidney Foundation and a variety of sources such as national institutes of health and medical research councils as well as foundations and industry sponsors supporting the authors and collaborating cohorts of the CKD-PC.\\nWomen have a \"female advantage\" when it comes to chronic kidney disease. When compared to men, they have fewer and less severe episodes of this disorder throughout most of their lives.\\nThat advantage disappears, however, when the woman is diabetic. For reasons still unclear, diabetic women -- regardless of age -- are diagnosed with kidney and heart diseases almost as frequently as men.\\nWhat is it about diabetes that predisposes a woman to develop renal disease at levels generally associated with her male counterpart?\\nResearchers at Georgetown University\\'s Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease have been studying the phenomenon and have identified a novel observation to help explain why. The leader of this research team and the Center\\'s Director of Diabetes Research is Dr. Christine Maric. She will discuss the state of the team\\'s findings entitled, \"Sex, Diabetes and Renal Injury,\" at the upcoming conference, Sex and Gender in Cardiovascular-Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology. The meeting, sponsored by the American Physiological Society is being held August 9-12, 2007 in Austin, TX.\\nBackground\\nWomen are infrequently diagnosed with kidney or heart disease until they reach menopause. At menopause, when their sex hormone -- estrogen -- begins to disappear from their system, the rate of kidney disease begins to increase. As a result, estrogen is believed to have a protective effect against developing kidney and heart disease.\\nUnlike their non-diabetic counterparts of any age, women with diabetes are found to have similar rates of kidney and heart disease as males. Diabetic women are also known to have high rates of stillborn births, experience higher rates of menstrual difficulties, and have trouble conceiving.\\nStudies\\nIn an effort to understand why women with diabetes are more likely to get kidney disease than their non-diabetic female counterparts, the Georgetown researchers conducted several studies in which they determined that:\\nConclusion\\nThese findings suggest that sex hormones play a significant role in the development of diabetic kidney disease. According to Maric, \"Our observations suggest that kidney disease in diabetic women may not be the result of absolute levels of hormones, as previously thought, but to the relative ratio of [sex hormone] androgen to estrogen. It may well be that the ratio of the two hormones is what determines the effect of the hormones in the diabetic kidney.\"\\nAccording to Dr. Maric, \"The biggest surprise has been the finding that sex hormones -- normally thought to control only the reproductive function -- are involved in controlling processes in non-reproductive organs, including the kidney. Moving forward, we need to look more deeply into understanding how sex hormones affect organ function in each gender.\"\\nGender influences the prevalence and progression rate of many renal diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The physiology behind gender differences and renal disease is still uncertain, but the distinct characteristics of male and female kidney size, along with diet and the presence of hypertension, have all been thought to play a part.\\nSex hormones (estrogen, testosterone) have also thought to contribute to the differences, as hormones may influence the body\\'s responses to renal injury. Estrogen especially may exert certain cellular effects on the kidney because it can suppress the growth of scar tissue as well as affect various growth factors which impact the kidney.\\nIn these studies, researchers either added supplemental levels of estrogen/testosterone to rats or castrated/performed ovariectomies in males and females rats, respectively. The studies found that estrogen helped to protect against kidney disease while testosterone proved to be detrimental to kidney health.\\nEstrogen in renal disease\\nPrevious studies using animal models have used hormonal manipulation to explore the effects of sex hormones on renal disease. In these studies, researchers either added supplemental levels of estrogen/testosterone to rats or castrated/performed ovariectomies in males and females rats, respectively. The studies found that estrogen helped to protect against kidney disease while testosterone proved to be detrimental to kidney health.\\nMore recently, Dr. Sharon Silbiger of the Department of Medicine/Division of Nephrology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY and her colleagues examined the direct effects of estrogen on the production of collagens (proteins that contribute to kidney scarring) in the cells located around the small blood vessels of the kidneys (cultured mesangial cells).  She and her colleagues found that:\\nRaloxifene and renal disease\\nSilbiger\\'s group is currently analyzing data from a clinical study of the osteoporosis prevention drug, raloxifene.  As raloxifene has estrogen-like properties, the researchers hypothesized that raloxifene may affect the progression of renal disease in these women.  Broad-based preliminary data from this study will be presented at the APS meeting, but more specific data will be held until the study results are published.\\nFemale kidneys are known to be more resilient to disease and injury, but males need not despair. A new USC Stem Cell-led study published in\\n\"By exploring how differences emerge in male and female kidneys during development, we can better understand how to address sex-related health disparities for patients with kidney diseases,\" said Professor Andy McMahon, the study\\'s corresponding author, and the director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\\nFirst authors Lingyun \"Ivy\" Xiong and Jing Liu from the McMahon Lab and their collaborators identified more than 1,000 genes with different levels of activity in male and female mouse kidneys, in a study supported by the National Institutes of Health. The differences were most evident in the section of the kidney\\'s filtering unit known as the proximal tubule, responsible for reabsorbing most of the nutrients such as glucose and amino acids back into the blood stream. Most of these sex differences in gene activity emerged as the mice entered puberty and became even more pronounced as they reached sexual maturity.\\nBecause female kidneys tend to fare better in the face of disease or injury, the researchers were interested how the gene activity of kidneys becomes \"feminized\" or \"masculinized\" -- and testosterone appeared to be the biggest culprit.\\nTo feminize the kidneys of male mice, two strategies worked equally well: castrating males before puberty and thus lowering their natural testosterone levels, or removing the cellular sensors known as androgen receptors that respond to male sex hormones.\\nIntriguingly, three months of calorie restriction -- which is an indirect way to lower testosterone -- produced a similar effect. Accordingly, calorie restriction has already been shown to mitigate certain types of kidney injuries in mice.\\nTo re-masculinize the kidneys of the castrated males, the researchers only needed to inject testosterone. Similarly, testosterone injection masculinized the kidneys of females who had their ovaries removed before puberty.\\nThe scientists performed some similar experiments with mouse livers. Although this organ also displays sex-related differences, the hormones and underlying factors driving these differences are very different than those at play in the kidney. This suggests that these sex-related organ differences emerged independently during evolution.\\nTo test whether the same genes are involved in sex-related kidney differences in humans, the scientists analyzed a limited number of male and female donor kidneys and biopsies. When it came to genes that differed in their activity between the sexes, there was a modest overlap of the human genes with the mouse genes.\\n\"There is much more work to be done in studying sex-related differences in normal human kidneys,\" said McMahon. \"Given the divergent outcomes for male and female patients with kidney disease and injury, this line of inquiry is important for making progress toward eventually closing the gap on these sex-related health disparities.\"\\nAdditional authors are Kari Koppitch, Jin-Jin Guo, Megan Rommelfanger, and Adam L.

The researchers found that transplant recipients were four times more likely to be diagnosed with regional stage melanoma, which has already begun to spread to other parts of the body.\\n\"We knew that melanoma was more likely in transplant recipients, but we thought it might be a function of intensive screening since they are very likely to develop less deadly forms of skin cancer and are checked regularly by dermatologists,\" says Hilary A. Robbins, MSPH, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School who conducted much of the research while working at the National Cancer Institute. \"To the contrary, we were surprised to see that transplant recipients were particularly at risk for developing melanomas that weren\\'t found until they had already spread.\"\\nThe researchers were also surprised to see that the risk of aggressive melanomas was especially increased within the first four years after transplant. Previously, they thought that immunosuppressant medications might act cumulatively and that these cancers would be more likely after many years of taking the drugs. Transplant patients must take immunosuppressant medications for the rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection.\\nIn 2011, there were more than 65,000 cases of melanoma in the United States, making it the deadliest form of skin cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Melanoma can spread to other parts of the body and causes over 9,000 deaths every year. It is most commonly linked to exposure to the ultraviolet rays given off by the sun.\\nSome types of cancer are more common among immune-suppressed people, such as those infected with HIV and transplant recipients. But Robbins says these are typically cancers that are linked to viruses like cervical cancer, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and lymphoma. Melanoma is not linked to a virus.\\nFor their research, Robbins and the team studied 139,991 non-Hispanic white transplant recipients in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, which is led by Eric A. Engels, MD, MPH, a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute. The study links the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, which captures data on all transplants in the United States, with 15 population-based cancer registries, and includes information on almost half of the country\\'s transplant population between 1987 and 2010. The researchers found 519 melanomas in this group and analyzed risk factors for developing melanoma.\\nUsing a different data set, the researchers compared outcomes among 182 melanoma patients in the transplant group with more than 130,000 other people with melanoma. Over 15 years, 27 percent of the transplant recipients died of their melanoma, as compared to 12 percent of the non-recipients. The researchers found that melanoma patients who had received a transplant were three times more likely to die from their melanoma, even for melanomas that were diagnosed at an early stage or were very small.\\nThe researchers found that the late-stage cases of melanoma were associated with use of medication given at the time of transplant that essentially stops T-cells -- the main cells of immune response -- from functioning in order to keep them from attacking the new organ. Meanwhile, early-stage melanomas were more likely to be found in recipients who were administered a medication called azathioprine, a maintenance drug given long term to some transplant recipients. This drug is known to multiply the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to the development of melanoma.\\nRobbins says her group\\'s findings suggest that transplant candidates should be screened very carefully for skin cancers before receiving their transplant. She says it is possible that some of the melanomas could have been present at the time of transplant, but that immunosuppressive drugs allowed them to spread unchecked. She also says that closer monitoring after transplant could allow melanoma to be detected earlier, preventing patients from developing deadly metastatic cancer.\\nMany researchers are working to develop transplant protocols that reduce or even eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications, as these make organ recipients more likely to develop other medical problems.\\nFor patients with kidney failure, poor kidney function and immunosuppressant medications may increase their risk of developing different types of cancer. The findings, which are published in a study appearing in an upcoming issue of the\\nPeople with kidney failure are at increased risk of developing different types of cancer, which might be due to a variety of factors related to their disease and the treatments they receive. Often these patients undergo intervals of dialysis followed by transplantation, and then they return to dialysis if the transplant fails. Understanding how these different exposures correspond to cancer risk can help inform cancer prevention and screening decisions for patients and can provide insights into the underlying causes of cancer.\\nTo investigate, Elizabeth Yanik, PhD, ScM (National Cancer Institute) and her colleagues evaluated information on 202,195 kidney transplant candidates and recipients by linking the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to various US population-based cancer registries. For a number of cancers, the team observed clear patterns of risk that corresponded to different treatment intervals. For example, risk of kidney and thyroid cancers was high across all intervals, but the risk was particularly heightened when individuals were on dialysis. Conversely, risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, lung cancer, and certain skin cancers was highest following kidney transplantation and--for those who experienced it-- prior to transplant failure. This may have been due to the effects of immunosuppressant medications that are needed while living with a functioning kidney transplant.\\nThese findings reveal that kidney dysfunction and immunosuppressant medications can have important effects on cancer incidence in patients with kidney failure.\\n\"Our study indicates that the needs of individuals with end-stage renal disease, in terms of cancer prevention and cancer screening, will likely differ over time,\" said Dr. Yanik. \"Vigilance for kidney cancer and thyroid cancer may be of particular importance while these individuals are on dialysis.

Using a mouse model of MS, they have identified a guardian molecule -- triggered by testosterone -- that appears to protect males from disease. When female mice with disease are treated with this protective molecule, their symptoms were eliminated, reports a new study from Northwestern Medicine.\\n\"This suggests a mechanism for the reduced incidence of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases in males compared to females,\" said lead study author Melissa Brown, professor of microbiology/immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"These findings could lead to an entirely new kind of therapy for MS, which we greatly need.\"\\nThe paper will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Jan. 29.\\nWomen have three-to-four times the incidence of MS compared to men and the lower incidence in males is related, in part, to higher levels of testosterone. But until now, scientists haven\\'t understood how the hormone provides protection. The new study discovered how testosterone does it, and how females can glean the benefits.\\n\"This is why it\\'s vital to study sex differences in research,\" Brown said.\\nThe discovery stemmed from an earlier lucky mistake in the lab in which male mice were used instead of female mice, because a graduate student hadn\\'t yet learned to identify the nearly imperceptible genitals of male mouse pups.\\nIn MS, immune cells attack the myelin sheath, a membrane that wraps around the nerve axons within the brain and spinal cord. The sheath acts as insulation and assists in sending nerve signals from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The damage to the myelin sheath interrupts normal nerve signal conduction and can result in a variety of symptoms including sensory disturbances, loss of motor function and cognitive deficits.\\nNorthwestern scientists showed that testosterone caused mast cells, a type of immune cell, to produce the guardian molecule, cytokine IL-33, in male mice. The guardian molecule triggers a cascade of chemicals that prevents the development of another type of immune cell, so-called Th17 cells, that can directly attack the myelin.\\nIn this model of disease, similar to MS in humans, females develop more of a disease-causing Th17 immune response than males. These Th17 cells, attack and destroy the myelin. But that damaging response was reversed in females by treatment with IL-33.\\n\"Because testosterone levels are seven-to-eight times lower in adult women compared to men, we speculate there are insufficient levels in females to activate this protective pathway,\" Brown said. \"But we showed we can activate the pathway with the guardian molecule, IL-33.\"\\nIn addition to a higher incidence of MS in women, there are also sex-determined differences in the average age of onset and subtype of the disease. Women generally develop MS at a younger age and usually have a relapsing-remitting course of disease. Men develop the disease later in life and it usually continues to worsen without periods of improvement. The development of the disease in men also correlates with age-related reduction of testosterone levels.\\nWhile there have been some new breakthroughs in developing effective drug therapies for MS patients, most of these work by suppressing the immune system, making patients more susceptible to certain infections and/or causing a general malaise.\\nLimited clinical trials in male MS patients have shown that testosterone treatment over 12 months can partially reverse evidence of myelin- and nerve-degeneration and alleviate symptoms. However, short-term testosterone administration is not a viable therapy for either men or women because of the multitude of undesirable side effects.\\n\"Our findings have identified new and more specific cellular and molecular targets for immune intervention that we hope will lead to better therapies that leave most of the immune system intact,\" Brown said. \"This testosterone-driven protective pathway should also be studied in other female-biased autoimmune diseases.\"\\nAmid growing indications that the traditional image of red blood cells (RBCs) falls short of reality, chemists are reporting evidence that RBCs are key participants in a communication system among cells in the bloodstream.\\nMessaging between RBCs and platelets (blood components that cause clotting) they say, could explain the effects of a drug suggested for use in preventing heart attacks and other complications of diabetes.\\nIn a study scheduled for the July 13 issue of ACS’ Analytical Chemistry, a semi-monthly journal, Dana Spence and colleagues note that RBCs once were regarded mainly as oxygen carriers. Recent research, however, shows that red cells also release ATP, a molecule that is the source of energy for all life processes, as they deform while they travel through small blood vessels.\\nBy observing blood flow through artificial blood vessels in laboratory experiments, Spence’s group now has established that the ATP signals blood platelets to produce nitric oxide (NO). That messenger molecule has a variety of functions, including dilating blood vessels. When released from platelets, NO helps regulate platelets’ activity, preventing excessive clotting. Disruption of the RBC-platelet communications system may play a role in diabetic complications such as heart disease and strokes, the researchers said.\\nThe new study also found that Trental, reported to have beneficial effects in preventing certain diabetic complications, may work by boosting ATP release from red blood cells.\\nWhat is the connection between a fly’s aerodynamic skill and human heart function? Using the nation’s most brilliant X-rays, located at the Advanced Photon Source at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, a cardiac molecular motors expert from the University of Vermont (UVM) and colleagues from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and Caltech performed research to answer that and other questions.\\nThe research team, including David Maughan, Ph.D., research professor of molecular physiology and biophysics at the UVM College of Medicine, published their results in a report in the Jan. 20 issue of the British journal Nature.\\nTo conduct their research, Maughan and his IIT and Caltech colleagues merged extremely bright X-ray beams and a “virtual-reality flight simulator” for flies, designed by Michael Dickinson of Caltech, to probe the muscles in a flying fruit fly and examine how it generates the extraordinary levels of power that result in flight.\\nThe intense X-rays allowed the researchers to identify changes in the crystal-like arrangement of molecules responsible for generating the rapid contractions of the fly’s muscle with a resolution of 6/10,000th of a second. The flight simulator, which fools a tethered fly into thinking it is flying freely through the air, is necessary to produce a stable pattern of wing motion and enabled the team to capture X-ray images at different stages of muscle contraction. By combining the technologies, the researchers could reconstruct a ‘movie’ of the molecular changes in the powerful muscles as they lengthen and shorten to drive the wings back and forth 200 times each second.\\n“At the molecular level, the insect’s flight muscle and a human heart are remarkably similar,” Maughan said. “We biologists have always been amazed by how hard these muscles work. Now we have taken advantage of the fruit fly’s small size and shone light right through the whole animal, illuminating the working muscles during flight and probing the molecular motions deep within the muscle cells.”\\nThese experiments uncovered previously unsuspected interactions of various proteins as the muscles stretch and contract. The results suggest a model for how these powerful biological motors turn “on” and “off” during the wingbeat.\\n“Small flying insects face an enormous task — generating enough power to overcome gravity, air resistance and drag — and they do this by beating their wings ferociously,” said Maughan. “We found out that timing is key, where certain molecules have to be positioned exactly with respect to others during each phase of the wing beat in order to produce the high power output.”\\nThe researchers note that the many similarities between insect muscle and other oscillatory muscles, including human cardiac muscle, mean that the research may be adaptable for other uses.\\n“Both insect flight and human heart muscles store energy during each beat that is later used to help flap the wings or expand the heart after contraction. We found that flying insects store much of the elastic energy in the protein filaments themselves, which minimizes the power costs,” Maughan said.\\nA previous publication by Maughan and Tom Irving of IIT demonstrated the feasibility of taking movies of molecular changes in live flies. UVM’s Instrument and Model Facility (IMF), directed by Tobey Clark, built a rotating shutter used in the earlier experiment. IMF scientists Carl Silver and Gill Gianetti fabricated the high-speed device.\\n“How the fly’s muscles turn off and on at 200 times a second has been a mystery that we now can solve in detail using these new technologies” Maughan said.\\nMaughan and his colleagues’ research experiences with genetically malleable fruit flies has increased the potential for addressing much more specific questions about the roles of various protein components in muscle function using mutant or genetically-engineered flies. Currently, Maughan is collaborating with Jim Vigoreaux, Ph.D., associate professor of biology at UVM, and Doug Swank of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to determine what parts of the flight muscle proteins are responsible for the high speed.\\nCollaborators on the X-ray project, in addition to Dickinson and Maughan, are Gerrie Farman, Tanya Bekyarova and David Gore of IIT, and Mark Frye of Caltech.\\nChildren in the German-speaking part of Switzerland who utilise extended education offerings in the first two years of primary school generally perform no better in school than other children, an SNSF-funded project has found. Overall, the research shows that all-day schools do not fulfil all the expectations people place in them.\\nExpectations are high for non-compulsory, \"open\" all-day schools (a form of extended education also known as student clubs, daycare centres or \"day structures,\" depending on the canton). Extended education offerings at school are intended to promote equal opportunity and integration and lead to better educational achievement. It is also aimed at helping more women return to the work force.\\nThe goal of a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) was to investigate whether all-day schools have actually achieved the desired impact on students. The conclusion: \"In their current design, the offerings are not having the hoped-for effect,\" says Marianne Schüpbach, professor of primary education at the University of Bamberg, Germany, and project head of the study, which combines the results of several years of research work. The findings have been published in an edited volume.\\nAs part of the EduCare research programme, the project focused on three specific areas: development of first and second grade students attending open all-day schools, the educational quality and the utilisation of the extended education offerings. Roughly 2000 first and second grade students were surveyed and followed up. The sample represented 120 classes at 53 all-day schools in 13 cantons in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.\\nNo difference in educational achievement\\n\"Attendance in the first two years of school had no effect on educational achievement,\" says Schüpbach. In contrast, utilisation of extended education offerings did have a compensatory effect on the mathematics achievements of students from families of low socioeconomic status. However, \"language achievement was no better for so-called at-risk children from families with a migration background and with low socioeconomic status compared with the group that utilised no extended education offerings,\" says Schüpbach.\\nThe study also investigated how children who utilise extended education offerings develop socially and emotionally. As regards social behaviour that has a positive effect on other people, no difference was found between students who utilise offerings compared with those who do not. However, the composition of a group had an impact on the development of behavioural problems in individual children: children placed in a group with many children with behavioural problems showed less improvement of the disruptive behaviour than in the comparison group. \"This finding shows that a healthy mix of students is important,\" says Schüpbach. In addition, there is a need to examine measures, such as increasing the number of caregivers, sensitisation of staff or introducing specific interventions to counter these disadvantageous effects.\\nNot enough targeted support\\nThe study has also established that the educational quality of extended education offerings has improved slightly in the last 10 years and is of average to good quality. However, the main components of these offerings are still homework, lunchtime and the afternoon snack. The researchers also looked at which activities are made available to children. It became clear that \"Freispiel\" -- unstructured play activities -- are particularly important for all-day schools in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. By the same token, there are very few guided activities, for example in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) or in the area of language. \"This is the main difference between extracurricular programmes in other countries, like the USA, which offer ongoing, stimulating, targeted and clearly structured programmes to specifically support languages or areas like social behaviour. At all-day schools in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, there is a lot of room for improvement of the learning setting and the offerings,\" says Schüpbach.\\nThe findings point to a discrepancy between the actual function and the expectations of parents, who send their children to all-day schools to encourage them: \"In German-speaking Switzerland, all-day schools are more oriented towards child care and less towards education.\"\\nCost shuts out the middle class\\nThe project further showed that students with a migration background as well as children from families with high socioeconomic status and thus high income are more likely to utilise extended education offerings. Children from families with middle-class incomes utilised the offerings the least. \"The reason is means-tested cost-sharing,\" says Schüpbach. For families with middle-class incomes, the offerings are often too expensive. \"It might be a good idea to rethink the cost structure, so that extended education offerings could also be affordable for families with middle-class incomes, and to ensure a healthy mix of students.\"\\nPreoperative 3-dimensional visualization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) with a technique known as single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of detection of positive SLNs and a higher rate of disease-free survival among patients with melanoma, according to a study in the September 12 issue of\\n\"Melanoma has become an increasing interdisciplinary public health challenge worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than any other cancer in the world. Melanoma is the third most common cancer in Australia and the fifth most common cancer in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 70,230 new melanomas were diagnosed in the United States during 2011, resulting in approximately 8,790 deaths,\" according to background information in the article. \"Because melanoma, depending on tumor depth, metastasizes early into regional lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) is probably the most important diagnostic and potentially therapeutic procedure for patients with melanoma. The histological status of the sentinel lymph node is the most relevant prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with melanoma, independent of primary tumor thickness.\" The authors add that the recently introduced hybrid single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging technique could help overcome the high false-negative rate of SLNE by providing additional anatomical information to the surgeon.\\nIngo Stoffels, M.D., of the University of Essen-Duisburg, Essen, Germany, and colleagues conducted a study to compare the association between SLNE with vs. without preoperative SPECT/CT imaging and metastatic node detection and disease-free survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma. The study included use of a melanoma patient database to identify a group of 464 patients eligible for SLNE between March 2003 and April 2011. A total of 403 patients with clinically negative lymph nodes, who underwent SLNE with or without preoperative SPECT/CT, qualified for subsequent analysis. Between March 2003 and October 2008, 254 patients with melanoma underwent SLNE without preoperative SPECT/CT. Between November 2008 and April 2011, all sentinel node scintigraphies (type of diagnostic imaging tests) were performed as SPECT/CT in 149 patients. Using SPECT/CT allowed SLNE in the head and neck area more frequently (2.0 percent for standard vs. 23.5 percent for SPECT/CT).\\nA total of 833 SLNs were removed from 403 patients. The researchers found 2.40 SLNs per patient in the SPECT/CT group and 1.87 SLNs per patient in the standard group; 51 of 358 excised SLNs (14.2 percent) in the SPECT/CT cohort and 54 of 475 SLNs (11.4 percent) in the standard cohort showed metastatic involvement. The authors were able to identify 41 patients (27.5 percent) with positive SLNs in the SPECT/CT cohort and 48 (18.9 percent) with positive SLNs in the standard cohort. The number of positive SLNs per patient was significantly higher in the SPECT/CT cohort than in the standard cohort (0.34 vs. 0.21).\\n\"The local relapse rate in the SPECT/CT cohort was lower than in the standard cohort (6.8 percent vs. 23.8 percent,), which prolonged 4-year disease-free survival (93.9 percent vs. 79.2 percent),\" the researchers write.\\nThe authors note that with the SPECT/CT technique, they were able to use smaller incisions in the head and neck area as well as alternative entry points due to the exact anatomical localization of the SLN.\\n\"In conclusion, the preoperative visualization of SLN with SPECT/CT is technically feasible and facilitates the detection of additional positive SLNs. The use of this technique offers the physician the preoperative possibility of determining the exact location and visualization of the SLN …,\" the researchers write. \"In patients with cutaneous melanoma, the use of SPECT/CT-aided SLNE compared with SLNE alone was associated with higher detection of metastatic involvement and a higher rate of disease-free survival.\"\\nMany heart transplant patients develop multiple skin cancers, with increased risk for some skin cancers among patients with other cancers and with increasing age, according to a report in the December issue of\\n\"Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk for skin cancers,\" the authors write as background information in the article. \"Incidence, tumor burden and risk factors for skin cancer are well documented in renal transplant recipients. However, these characteristics are documented to a lesser extent in heart transplant patients, who are at least twice as likely to have skin cancer compared with renal transplant recipients.\" Reasons for this could include the greater use of immunosuppressive medications and an older average age at the time of transplant.\\nJerry D. Brewer, M.D., of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., and colleagues reviewed the records of 312 patients who had received heart transplants between 1988 and 2006. Patients had an average age of 47.4 years at the time of their transplant and information was extracted from their charts regarding overall characteristics, cancers, risk factors and death.\\nThe patients developed a total of 1,395 skin cancers; overall, 46.4 percent of the patients had developed skin cancer during the 19 years of follow-up. This included 1,236 squamous cell carcinomas and 151 basal cell carcinomas (the non-melanoma skin cancers), five malignant melanomas and three other types.\\nWhen evaluating the tumor burden of the 312 patients, 76 (24.4 percent) had at least one squamous cell carcinoma, 24 (7.7 percent) had only one squamous cell carcinoma and 19 (6.1 percent) had 10 or more; in addition, 54 (17.3 percent) had at least one basal cell carcinoma, 23 (7.4 percent) had only one and two (0.6 percent) had 10 or more.\\nPatients were more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma if they had other types of cancer after their transplant, were older or had a known cause for their heart failure. Infection with the herpes simplex virus, being older and using a medication known as mycophenolate to suppress the immune system were associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma.\\n\"Although a considerable tumor burden was found in this study, the rate of death due to skin cancer was surprisingly low. Only one patient died of skin cancer, of a melanoma,\" the authors write. \"Health care providers and patients at our center have been educated for more than 10 years about the risk, early detection and treatment of skin cancer, which is apparent from the low mortality rate seen in the patients of this study.\"\\n\"Vigilant sun protection practices, skin cancer education, regular skin examinations and daily vitamin D supplementation are appropriate interventions in these high-risk heart transplant patients,\" they conclude.\\nSome studies have shown that nicotine, an addictive substance in electronic cigarettes, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. But to get a full understanding of its potential health effects, a real-time nicotine monitoring device is needed. Such a device could also help vapers -- as well as non-vapers who encounter second-hand smoke -- measure their exposure. Now, researchers report in\\nE-cigarettes are designed to heat and aerosolize a mixture of nicotine, glycerine, propylene glycol and flavoring additives, which the user then inhales. In the body, this mixture can affect multiple organs, including the respiratory system, where it alters airflow, increases oxidative stress and impairs immunity. In addition, nicotine exposure can lead to lung cancer. But assessing that exposure under real-world conditions has been difficult. Current assays for measuring ambient nicotine levels are carried out in laboratory settings and require large sample volumes and days to weeks of sampling. Portable nicotine sensors are being developed as an alternative, but the two that have been reported are impractical because they rely either on the presence of sweat or sunlight to function. So Madhu Bhaskaran, Md. Ataur Rahman and Philipp Gutruf set out to design a lightweight, wearable sensor capable of detecting nicotine in real time and sending the data wirelessly to electronic devices such as a smartphone.\\nThe team chose vanadium dioxide (VO2) on a polyimide substrate as the basis for their sensor. They showed that nicotine can bond covalently to a thin film of VO2, thereby altering the film\\'s conductivity to an extent that depends on nicotine concentration. The device detects the change in conductivity, amplifies the signal and then transmits it wirelessly to a smartphone. When applied to skin, the battery-free sensor can measure the wearer\\'s exposure to vaporized nicotine in open air. The researchers say this approach expands the use of wearable electronics for real-time monitoring of hazardous substances in the environment.\\nWomen who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are more likely to develop breast cancer or ovarian cancer, especially at a younger age. Approximately 5 percent of women with breast cancer in the United States have mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 based on estimates in non-Hispanic white women. Moffitt Cancer Center researchers recently conducted the largest U.S. based study of BRCA mutation frequency in young black women diagnosed with breast cancer at or below age 50 and discovered they have a much higher BRCA mutation frequency than that previously reported among young white women with breast cancer.\\nYoung black women are more likely to have aggressive types of breast cancer compared to non-Hispanic white women, yet the reason for this disparity remains uncertain. Moffitt researchers wanted to assess if mutations in the BRCA gene could help account for this higher rate of aggressive breast cancers among young black women in the U.S. They analyzed the BRCA mutation frequency and family history of 396 black women in Florida who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer under the age of 50. They discovered that 12.4 percent of the participants had mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2.\\nFurthermore, over 40 percent of those with a mutation had no close relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, which suggests that family history alone, may not identify those at risk for carrying a BRCA mutation.\\nAs personalized medicine becomes more integrated into clinical care, it is becoming increasingly important for physicians to be aware of potential BRCA mutations at the time of diagnosis to be able to recommend the best therapy for their patients. \"Our results suggest that it may be appropriate to recommend BRCA testing in all black women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed at or below age 50,\" said Tuya Pal, M.D., a clinical geneticist at Moffitt, who led this effort.\\nHowever, many minorities do not undergo recommended genetic testing and counseling. According to an earlier report by the same researchers published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, only about half of the black women were referred for or received genetic counseling or testing. They discovered that healthcare providers tend to refer patients for genetic counseling more frequently if the patients have a college education, are 45 years of age or younger, or have triple negative breast cancer.\\nAdditionally, black patients are more likely to seek genetic services if they receive a physician\\'s referral, have private health insurance, and higher incomes. \"Overall, our results suggest that there is a great need to improve access to genetic services among high-risk black women.\" says lead author of this report, Deborah Cragun, Ph.D., researcher and genetic counselor at Moffitt.\\nPatients who become aware of BRCA mutations can choose to have more breast cancer screening, or preventative mastectomies or oophorectomies. Additionally, this knowledge can be shared with family members so they can also be more proactive about cancer prevention. \"Women who are identified with a mutation have an opportunity to be proactive about their health through cancer preventive options,\" explained Susan Vadaparampil, Ph.D., M.P.H., behavioral scientist at Moffitt, who co-led this effort.\\nThis study was published online ahead of print publication in Cancer and was supported by grants from Florida Biomedical (IBG10-34199), the American Cancer Society (RSG-11-268-01-CPPB), the Florida Breast Cancer Foundation and a training grant from the National Cancer Institute (5R25CA147832-05).\\nA new study has found that an Inuit population in Canada\\'s Arctic are genetically distinct from any known group, and certain genetic variants are correlated with brain aneurysm.\\nGeographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Unfortunately, these adaptations sometimes predispose them to certain health issues if the environment is changed. The genetic background of these populations are often poorly understood because they live far from scientific research centres.\\nCanada\\'s Inuit have higher prevalence of cardiovascular disorders, as well as increased incidence of brain aneurysms, than the general population. To learn about the possible genetic origin of these disorders, researchers at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital) of McGill University analyzed the genetic characteristics of 170 Inuit volunteers from Nunavik, a region of northern Quebec. This was done with approval from Nunavik Nutrition and Health Committee in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik.\\nUsing exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping, the researchers found several interesting traits among the Nunavik Inuit. They are a distinct genetic population, whose closest relatives are the Paleo-Eskimos, a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit.\\nThe Nunavik Inuit have distinct genetic signatures in pathways involving lipid metabolism and cell adhesion. These may be adaptations to adjust to the high-fat diet and extreme cold of the Canadian north.\\nOne of these unique genetic variants correlates with a higher risk of brain aneurysm, also known as intracranial aneurysm, a weakening in the wall of a cerebral artery that causes ballooning. In serious cases the arterial wall may rupture, a potentially fatal condition known as a brain hemorrhage.\\nThis study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first genetic study to highlight the genome-wide architecture of Nunavik Inuit with emphasis on natural selection in gene coding regions, from which may arise the genetic risk responsible for their predisposition to diseases such as intracranial aneurysm.\\nNon-European populations, particularly those isolated populations in remote areas of the world, are underrepresented, or not present at all, in genetics studies. Understanding the genetic makeup of non-European peoples, especially those isolated populations with unique genetic background, such as Nunavik Inuit, will improve our ability to deliver medical therapies tailored for them.\\n\"In the case of the Nunavik Inuit, our results emphasize the need to provide effective neurological services,\" says Dr. Guy Rouleau, the study\\'s senior author. \"Future research will build on the findings to determine if these unique genetic traits increase risk of aneurysm, and if so, what interventions can be designed to reduce this risk. Thank you to the study participants and the Nunavik Nutrition and Health Committee for their collaboration and input.\"\\nThis research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.\\nSan Diego -- Positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans of a brainchemical messenger system may prove sensitive enough to help plan brainsurgery for epilepsy, according to a study presented at the 130thannual meeting of the American Neurological Association in San Diego.\\n\"Our preliminary data suggest that PET imaging with a marker thatshows deficits in signaling for the neurotransmitter serotonin is moresensitive than the traditional PET measurement of brain glucose,\" saidsenior author William H. Theodore MD, chief of the Clinical EpilepsySection at the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders andStroke.\\nWhen drugs fail to control epilepsy, brain surgery is often theonly remaining therapeutic option. However, identifying the correctspot for surgery has traditionally required a separate preliminary --and inherently risky -- surgical procedure.\\nEpilepsy is a chronic illness of the brain that is estimated toaffect almost one percent of the U.S. population. During an epilepticseizure, nerve cells in the brain fire electrical impulses much fasterthan normal, often leading to loss of consciousness.and convulsions\\nIn a subset of cases, the seizures always begin the same,identifiable area of the brain, then spread to other areas. Surgery toremove the area where seizures start can be safe and effective.\\n\"About 30% of patients with epilepsy, or approximately 600,000people in the U.S., have seizures that are not controlled byantiepileptic drugs. Surgery may be an option for some of these, andlocalizing the epileptic focus is crucial,\" said Theodore.\\nBoth PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are underinvestigation as tools to guide neurosurgeons to areas of the brainwhere epileptic seizures originate.\\nTheodore and colleagues at NINDS have found, in their pilotstudy, that a marker for serotonin systems was able to identifyepilepsy-generating brain areas even in a patient with a normal MRI.\\nIn related studies, the researchers have found that thesedeficits in serotonin correlate with the likelihood that patients withepilepsy will also suffer from depression.\\nTheodore cautions that this is a preliminary study of aprocedure that is still in the research stages. However, he suggeststhat physicians should not hesitate to treat patients with epilepsy anddepression with effective antidepressant drugs, and to refer patientsfor surgical evaluation if seizures are not controlled by antiepilepticdrugs.\\nSerotonin 1A receptor imaging and temporal lobectomy.RobertBonwetsch, MD, Giampiero Giovacchini, MD, Richard Carson, PhD, PatriciaReeves-Tyer, Kathy Kelley, MA, Peter Herscovitch, MD and William HTheodore, MD. Bethesda, Maryland.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) may provide supportive datafor detecting epileptogenic zones in patients with temporal lobeepilepsy (TLE), helping to reduce the need for invasive EEG studies.Serotonin (5HT) 1A receptor binding has been shown to be decreased inTLE. We used PET to compare 5HT-1A binding measured with the silentantagonist 18FCWAY, to glucose metabolism measured with 18FDG, in 19patients who had temporal lobectomy for uncontrolled epilepsy, and amean follow-up of 31 months. We analyzed PET data with co-registeredMRI and partial volume correction, computing an asymmetry index (AI)using the formula [2] x [ipsilateral contralateral]/[ipsilateral +contralateral] for anatomic regions drawn on each patient sco-registered MRI scan. Mean FDG asymmetry in the resected region was0.25 0.18, versus 0.47 0.20 for FCWAY (P<0.001). Three patients,including one with normal MRI, had unrevealing FDG PET but a clearFCWAY asymmetry. There was a trend for 13 patients who wereseizure-free to have greater FCWAY (p<0.08), but not FDG AI, than 6patients with persistent seizures. Our preliminary results suggest thatFCWAY PET may be more sensitive than FDG for presurgical evaluation oftemporal lobe epilepsy.\\nResearchers at Baylor College of Medicine, Shandong University in China and other institutions may have found an explanation for dawn phenomenon, an abnormal increase of blood sugar only in the morning, observed in many patients with type 2 diabetes. They report in the journal\\nThe researchers then looked at Rev-erb gene expression in patients with type 2 diabetes comparing a group with dawn phenomenon to a group without it and found that the gene\\'s expression followed a different temporal pattern between these two groups. The findings support the idea that an altered daily rhythm of expression of the Rev-erb gene may underlie dawn phenomenon. Future investigations may lead to therapies.\\n\"We began this study to investigate what was the function of Rev-erb in the brain,\" said co-corresponding author Dr. Zheng Sun, associate professor of medicine-endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Baylor. \"We are interested in this gene because it is a \\'druggable\\' component of the circadian clock with potential applications in the clinic. Rev-erb is expressed only during the day but not at night. When we started, we did not know where this was going to lead us.\"\\nThe researchers first developed a mouse model by knocking out the Rev-erb gene in GABA neurons. They chose this approach because the gene\\'s expression is highly enriched in a particular brain area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that is mainly composed of GABA neurons.\\nAn unexpected finding\\n\"We observed something very interesting in these mice,\" Sun said. \"They were glucose intolerant -- that is they had high glucose levels -- only in the evening. Mice are nocturnal, meaning that they become active in the evening as people do in the morning.\"\\nWhen the body awakes and takes in food, insulin is secreted from the pancreas to signal the body to lower blood sugar. Insulin is more effective in doing this job upon waking than at other times of the day. This high insulin sensitivity is probably because the body is anticipating feeding behaviors upon waking up. In mice, high insulin sensitivity occurs in the evening, while in people it occurs in the morning.\\nSun and his colleagues found that the abnormal higher glucose levels observed in the evening in Rev-erb knockout mice resulted from an insufficient suppression of liver glucose production by insulin. Their data demonstrate an essential role of neural Rev-erb in regulating the hepatic insulin sensitivity rhythm independent of eating behaviors or basal hepatic glucose production.\\nNext, the researchers looked to understand how defects in Rev-erb gene expression in the brain can result in changes in the ability of the liver to respond to insulin. They discovered that the suprachiasmatic nucleus GABA neurons in Rev-erb knockout mice had a higher firing activity than those neurons of normal mice when the animals woke up, and that this neuronal hyperactivity was sufficient and necessary to cause glucose intolerance in the evening. In normal mice, these GABA neurons drop their firing activity in the evening, lowering sugar blood levels. Interestingly, by re-expressing Rev-erb back in the knockout mice, the researchers found that Rev-erb expression is only needed during the day, but not needed at night, which is in line with the highly oscillatory expression pattern of endogenous Rev-erb in normal condition.\\nConnecting with dawn phenomenon\\nMice having higher glucose levels in the evening reminded Sun and his colleagues of dawn phenomenon observed in people with type 2 diabetes. \"Given the similarities of the phenomenon in mice and people, we thought that maybe this gene that we are studying could be linked to the biology of dawn phenomena in diabetic patients,\" said Sun, a member of Baylor\\'s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Huffington Center on Aging.\\nIn collaboration with Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China, the researchers followed 27 type2 diabetes patients with continuous glucose monitoring. They found that, although the patients had diabetes with similar severity in terms of their basal glucose levels, obesity and other parameters, about half of the patients had dawn phenomenon while the other half did not.\\n\"We collected the patients\\' blood at different times of the day and determined the expression of the Rev-erb gene in white blood cells, which has been reported to correlate well with the central clock in the brain,\" Sun said. \"Interestingly, we found that the gene\\'s expression followed a temporal pattern that was different between those with dawn phenomenon and those without,\" Sun said. \"We propose that the altered temporal pattern of expression of this gene may explain dawn phenomena in people. It is possible that, in the future, a drug might be used to regulate this gene to treat the condition.\"\\nA study co-authored by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that telehealth consults among privately insured working-age patients accounted for almost 24 percent of outpatient consults with health care providers during the early phase of the pandemic, March to June 2020, up from less than 0.3 percent during the same period in 2019.\\nThe dramatic shift occurred as many medical practices halted or curtailed in-person office hours and patients stayed away from doctor\\'s offices out of fear of transmission during the early months of the pandemic. At the same time, insurance companies and the federal government relaxed policies around telehealth to meet demand for remote medical consults via internet video or telephone.\\nThe study was published online March 23 in JAMA Network Open.\\nFor their study, researchers from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Blue Health Intelligence®, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, analyzed anonymized claims data drawn from 36.6 million private insurance plan members who were of working age and continuously enrolled during the study period. The claims data for the study were provided by Blue Health Intelligence.\\nA total of 15 million telehealth claims were submitted during the March to June 2020 study period, with nearly three-quarters involving video support (74.4 percent) and fewer than one in ten occurring via phone (9.2 percent). Just over 3 percent (3.3 percent) were conducted either by email or chat while 13.1 percent were unspecified.\\nMental health consults were far more likely to take place virtually -- with 46.1 percent taking place via telehealth. By comparison, 22.1 percent of medical consults were virtual. In COVID-19 \"hot spot\" states -- those with a COVID-19 prevalence at least 1.5 times the national average -- 36 percent of all consults were telehealth versus 21.6 percent in areas with lower COVID-19 prevalence. The study also found that the greater the COVID-19 prevalence in a specific ZIP code, the higher the use of telehealth.\\n\"Telehealth has been around for a long time, but the recent increase has been enormous,\" says the study\\'s lead author, Jonathan Weiner, DrPH, co-director of the Center for Population Health Information Technology and professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School. \"These findings will not only help doctors and other clinicians plan for the future, they will also guide policymakers and technology companies, especially as we learn more about the challenges of accessing telehealth among older patients, the uninsured, and low-income patients.\"\\nAbout a quarter of consults, 24.2 percent, in urban areas were via telehealth. This compared to only 14.2 percent of visits for members who lived in more rural settings. Age and number of chronic diseases were associated with more frequent telehealth consults, with individuals age 18 to 49 and those with more than two chronic conditions using telehealth the most.\\nThe study also found that overall total medical care costs, including hospitalizations, dropped 15 percent, from $358 to $306 per person per month, from 2019 to 2020. Persons with at least one COVID-19-related consult in 2020 had more than three times the medical costs compared to those with no COVID-19-related services -- $1,701 per member per month versus $544, a difference of $1,157.\\nOverall, the researchers found that in-person, outpatient visits decreased by 37 percent, from an average of 1.63 visits per enrollee during the three-month 2019 study period to an average of 1.02 visits per enrollee in 2020. However, since telehealth visits filled much of the gap, the total combined in-person and virtual encounter rate dropped only 18 percent between 2019 and 2020.\\nFor persons with at least one COVID-19-related insurance claim, including screening and care, the average number of in-person and telehealth consults were about 30 percent higher than the average number of claims for persons with no COVID-19-related visit. One-quarter of COVID-19-related consults were via telehealth versus 23.5 percent for non-COVID-19-related consults.\\n\"Even though some of our findings are unique to the COVID-19 era, we need to consider what telehealth will look like beyond the pandemic,\" says Weiner. \"We will need to continue to assess and modify telehealth strategies to maximize value during this digital age, particularly given the challenges of the digital divide across social and geographic lines.\"\\n\"In-Person and Telehealth Ambulatory Contacts and Costs in a Large U.S. Insured Cohort Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for the Future of Virtual Care,\" was written by Jonathan Weiner, Stephen Bandeian, Elham Hatef, Daniel Lans, Angela Liu, and Klaus Lemke.\\nThe study was supported through internal funding from the Center for Population Health Information Technology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and from Blue Health Intelligence.\\nNASA\\'s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) partner Blue Origin conducted a successful pad escape test Oct. 19 at the company\\'s West Texas launch site in Van Horn, firing its pusher-escape motor and launching a full-scale suborbital crew capsule from a simulated propulsion module.\\nThe test was part of Blue Origin\\'s work supporting its funded Space Act Agreement with NASA during Commercial Crew Development Round 2 (CCDev2). Through initiatives like CCDev2, NASA is fostering the development of a U.S. commercial crew space transportation capability with the goal of achieving safe, reliable and cost-effective access to and from the International Space Station and low-Earth orbit. After the capability is matured and available to the government and other customers, NASA could contract to purchase commercial services to meet its station crew transportation needs.\\n\"The progress Blue Origin has made on its suborbital and orbital capabilities really is encouraging for the overall future of human spaceflight,\" CCP Manager Ed Mango said. \"It was awesome to see a spacecraft NASA played a role in developing take flight.\"\\nThe suborbital crew capsule traveled to an altitude of 2,307 feet (703 meters) during the flight test before descending safely by parachute to a soft landing 1,630 feet (497 meters) away.\\nThe pusher escape system was designed and developed by Blue Origin to allow crew escape in the event of an emergency during any phase of ascent for its suborbital New Shepard system. As part of an incremental development program, the results of this test will shape the design of the escape system for the company\\'s orbital biconic-shaped Space Vehicle. The system is expected to enable full reusability of the launch vehicle, which is different from NASA\\'s previous launch escape systems that would pull a spacecraft away from its rocket before reaching orbit.\\n\"The use of a pusher configuration marks a significant departure from the traditional towed-tractor escape tower concepts of Mercury and Apollo,\" said Rob Meyerson, president and program manager of Blue Origin. \"Providing crew escape without the need to jettison the unused escape system gets us closer to our goal of safe and affordable human spaceflight.\"\\nAll of NASA\\'s industry partners, including Blue Origin, continue to meet their established milestones in developing commercial crew transportation capabilities.\\nWhile NASA works with U.S. industry partners to develop commercial spaceflight capabilities, the agency also is developing the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS), a crew capsule and heavy-lift rocket to provide an entirely new capability for human exploration. Designed to be flexible for launching spacecraft for crew and cargo missions, SLS and Orion will expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and enable new missions of exploration into the solar system.\\nFor more information about NASA\\'s Commercial Crew Program, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew\\nZoos and aquariums could improve the lives of a wider range of their animals, new research suggests.\\nThe use of \"environmental enrichment\" (giving animals stimulating environments) has become increasingly common in zoos and aquariums in recent years.\\nThe new study, by the University of Exeter and Sparsholt College Hampshire, investigated whether zoos base their enrichment on evidence of what each species needs.\\nIt found this was the case for certain animals -- especially carnivores and parrots -- and certain types of enrichment.\\nHowever, the study identifies opportunities to \"diversify the enrichment types being offered and species being researched.\"\\n\"Our study shows that environmental enrichment is important, and zoos and aquariums are taking it seriously,\" said Dr Paul Rose, of the University of Exeter.\\n\"Enrichment is no longer an afterthought, as it was 15 or 20 years ago.\\n\"Based on our findings, we would urge zoos to keep doing enrichment, but with a greater focus on using the available evidence on what works for each species.\\n\"Keepers should ask themselves what behaviours are being promoted, and what evidence exists to show that this behaviour is natural and beneficial in the long term.\"\\nThe study examined a database of peer-reviewed studies, and two publications for zoo professionals.\\nOf the enrichment articles identified, almost 77% focussed on mammals, with 11% on birds, 6% on multiple species, 4% on reptiles and only a handful on amphibians, fish and invertebrates.\\nThis focus on certain \"high-profile\" species can lead to more and better-quality enrichment for some species than others.\\nHowever, the use of biological evidence to inform this enrichment was patchy in the case of mammals.\\nThe researchers also noted other differences. For example, enrichment for parrots was more often evidence-based than enrichment for penguins.\\nThe study identified a focus on certain types of enrichment, particularly nutritional enrichment -- where food is provided in a way that mimics the animal\\'s natural environment.\\nMeanwhile, there were far fewer articles on social enrichment, which focusses on the mix of individuals in a group, multiple mating options, etc.\\nJames Brereton, of Sparsholt College Hampshire, said: \"We encourage all zoos that practice enrichment to share their findings, as it may be that the range of enrichment being used isn\\'t always in the literature.\"\\nMore than 90 percent of cancer-related deaths are caused by the spread of cancer cells from their primary tumor site to other areas of the body. A new study has identified how one important gene helps cancer cells break free from the primary tumor.\\nA gene normally involved in the regulation of embryonic development can trigger the transition of cells into more mobile types that can spread without regard for the normal biological controls that restrict metastasis, the new study shows.\\nAnalysis of downstream signaling pathways of this gene, called SNAIL, could be used to identify potential targets for scientists who are looking for ways to block or slow metastasis.\\n\"This gene relates directly to the mechanism that metastatic cancer cells use to move from one location to another,\" said Michelle Dawson, an assistant professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"If you have a cell that overexpresses SNAIL, then it can potentially be metastatic without having any environmental cues that normally trigger this response.\"\\nThe study was sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was published December 9 in the Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).\\nPreviously, Dawson and Daniel McGrail, the lead author on the new study, published a study showing how ovarian cancer cells respond to the mechanics of their bodily environment. Their data showed that ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on soft tissues -- such as the fatty tissue that line the gut -- due to the mechanical properties of this environment. The finding is contrary to what is seen with other malignant cancer cells that seem to prefer stiffer tissues.\\nIn the new study, the researchers show how overexpression of the gene SNAIL in vitro allows breast cancer cells to operate independently of the mechanics of the environment inside the body. Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells metastasize by hijacking the process by which cells change their type from epithelial (cells that lack mobility) to mesenchymal (cells that can easily move). In the new study, the researchers examined the biophysical properties of breast cancer cells that had undergone this epithelial to mesenchymal transition (through overexpression of SNAIL).\\nThe research team measured the mechanical properties within the nucleus and cytosol of breast cancer cells, and then measured the surface traction forces and the motility of the cells on different substrates. They found that cells became much softer, which could help them spread throughout the body.\\nDawson\\'s lab collaborated with the lab of John McDonald, a professor in the School of Biology at Georgia Tech, to use microarray analysis to examine changes in genes related to the observed biophysical changes. The researchers found that regardless of the substrate that the cells were grown on, cells that overexpress SNAIL look and act like aggressive cancer cells.\\n\"We found that when the cells express SNAIL, they have biophysical properties that are similar to what we see for an activated metastatic cancer cell,\" Dawson said.\\nAlthough SNAIL triggers a transformation that helps cells move from the primary tumor to the metastatic site, once the cell arrives at the metastatic site and that tumor starts to grow, SNAIL no longer helps cancer progress. Though becoming softer may help cells spread to the secondary site, they were no longer sturdy enough to form a secondary tumor.\\n\"The cells need to transfer back to the epithelial state so they can withstand solid stress,\" Dawson said.\\nThe researchers hope that their unique blend of microarray analysis and characterization of physical changes in breast cancer cells undergoing metastasis could aid the search for ways to block or slow the spread of cancer.\\n\"We think this work has great potential to lead to a new approach to cancer therapeutics,\" said McDonald, who is also the director of the Integrated Cancer Research Center at Georgia Tech.\\nSmoking significantly increases the risk for head and neck cancers for both men and women, regardless of the anatomic site. Published in the journal Cancer, a large, prospective study confirmed strong associations between current and past cigarette smoking and malignancies of the head and neck in both genders.\\nCancers of the head and neck include cancers of the larynx, nasal passages/nose, oral cavity, and pharynx. Worldwide, more than 500,000 people are diagnosed with these cancers every year. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), men are more than three times more likely than women to be diagnosed with head and neck cancer and almost twice as likely to die from their disease.\\nWhile tobacco use has long been identified as an important risk factor for head and neck cancers, the new study finds that smoking plays a greater role in the development of head and neck cancer in women than men.\\nDr. Neal Freedman from the NCI and co-investigators analyzed data from 476,211 men and women prospectively followed from 1995 to 2000 to assess gender differences in risk for cancer in specific head and neck sites. Analysis showed that the risk of smoking leading to any type of head and neck cancer was significantly greater in women than in men. While 45 percent of these cancers could be attributed to smoking in men, 75 percent could be attributed to smoking in women.\\n\"Incidence rates of head and neck cancer were higher in men than in women in all categories examined,\" conclude the authors, \"but smoking was associated with a larger relative increase in head and neck cancer risk in women than in men.\" To reduce the burden of head and neck cancer, public health efforts should continue to aim at eliminating smoking in both women and men.\\nArticle: \"Prospective Investigation of the Cigarette Smoking-Head and Neck Cancer Association by Sex,\" Neal D.

A new way of transmitting information is emerging from the field of magnonics: instead of electron exchange, the waves generated in magnetic media could be used for transmission, but magnonics-based computing has been (too) slow to date. Scientists at the University of Vienna have now discovered a significant new method: When the intensity is increased, the spin waves become shorter and faster -- another step towards magnon computing. The results were published in the journal\\nMagnonics is a relatively new field of research in magnetism. Spin waves play a central role: A local disturbance in the magnetic order of a magnet can propagate as waves through a material. These waves are called spin waves, and the associated quasiparticles are called magnons. They carry information in the form of angular momentum pulses. Because of this property, they can be used as low-power data carriers in smaller and more energy-efficient computers of the future. The main challenge in magnonics is wavelength. The larger it is, the slower magnon-based data processing units are. Until now, the wavelength could only be shortened with very complex hybrid structures or a synchrotron. The research group \"Nanomagnetism and Magnononics\" at the University of Vienna, together with colleagues from Germany, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and China, has developed a simpler alternative. First author Qi Wang made the crucial observation after months of work in the Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy laboratory at the University of Vienna\\'s Faculty of Physics: if you increase the intensity, the spin waves become shorter and faster -- a breakthrough method for magnonic computing.\\nCo-author of the study and leader of the Vienna NanoMag team, Andrii Chumak, explains the discovery with a metaphor: \"It is helpful to imagine the method with light. If you change the wavelength of light, its color changes. But if you change the intensity, only the luminosity changes. In this case, we found a way to change the color by changing the intensity of the spin waves. This phenomenon allowed us to excite much shorter and much better spin waves,\" Chumak said.\\nThe current wavelength found with this system is about 200 nanometers. According to numerical simulations, it would be possible to excite even smaller wavelengths, but at this stage it is very difficult to excite or measure these orders of magnitude.\\nThe amplitudes of the spin waves are also crucial for future magnetic integrated circuits. The discovered system exhibits a self-locking nonlinear shift, which means that the amplitude of the excited spin waves is constant. This property is very relevant for integrated circuits, as it allows different magnetic elements to work together with the same amplitude. This, in turn, is fundamental to the construction of more complex systems and to the realization of the distant goal of a magnon-based computer. The ultimate goal, a fully functional magnon computer, has not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, this solid milestone brings researchers a good deal closer to their goal.\\nAnn Arbor, MI – A chemical cousin of anti-anxiety medications, such as Valium and Xanax, significantly reduces kidney inflammation in mice inbred to develop a disease resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of California-Berkeley have found. Their research, described in the Oct. 16 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, also reveals the novel mechanism by which the compound works, a discovery that could lead to safer and more effective new drugs for managing lupus and other autoimmune disorders.\\n\"The best available therapies for lupus haven\\'t changed for many, many years,\" says U-M\\'s Gary D. Glick, Ph.D., one of the lead authors on the study. \"It\\'s a disease where the mechanisms that normally prevent the immune system from attacking components of one\\'s own body are defective. Because we do not yet understand what triggers lupus, it has been very difficult to develop lupus-specific therapies.\"\\nIn fact, the mainstays of treating lupus-related kidney inflammation---the major cause of illness and death in lupus patients---are drugs developed many years ago to kill cancer cells. When given to lupus patients, often in combination with immune-suppressing steroids, these cytotoxic agents kill immune cells. But because they lack specificity, they also kill healthy cells, resulting in serious side effects. What\\'s more, they simply are not effective in some patients.\\n\"Our compound, on the other hand, goes in and kills the bad players but leaves the good players alone,\" says Glick, a charter faculty member of the U-M Life Sciences Institute, who is the Werner E. Bachmann Collegiate Professor of Chemistry, and a professor of biological chemistry in the U-M Medical School.\\nThe compound, a 1,4-benzodiazepine (designated as Bz-423), sets off a chain of events that results in apoptosis, a natural cell-suicide process by which the body rids itself of cells it no longer needs. In autoimmune disorders such as lupus, something interferes with apoptosis, and immune system cells survive and run amok instead of dying on cue. The abnormally surviving immune system cells produce antibodies, which attack the body\\'s healthy cells and tissues. The result is harmful and sometimes fatal inflammation in various tissues and organs, particularly the kidneys.\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lupus affects 1.4 million Americans, and more than 22,000 have died as a result of the disease over the past 20 years. Women of childbearing age are at greatest risk, and African Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop the disease, says Anthony Opipari, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and a lead author of the study.\\nIn an attempt to find new drugs for treating lupus, Glick and his co-workers screened a collection of benzodiazepines to identify any that killed immune cells. They chose benzodiazepines because unlike most cytotoxic drugs, these compounds do not damage DNA or interfere with cell metabolism. \"We suspected that any benzodiazepines that were capable of killing cells would possess unique modes of action and perhaps be better at targeting disease-causing cells,\" says Glick.\\nIn a series of experiments using cultured B cells (immune cells that make antibodies), the researchers found that Bz-423 targets a protein inside the cells\\' mitochondria. To test the effectiveness of Bz-423, Glick and his team then gave the compound to mice with lupus. At the end of the treatment period, 60% of untreated mice had lupus-related kidney disease, compared to 16% of treated mice. The treated mice showed none of the side effects caused by currently available lupus drugs.\\n\"The results suggest that Bz-423, when administered appropriately, may have a significant therapeutic potential for lupus,\" says Glick. There is also evidence that Bz-423 may be useful in treating some types of cancer, as well as other autoimmune diseases, and the researchers are actively pursuing these possibilities, according to Opipari.\\n\"This paper illustrates the wonderful opportunities there are for chemists, such as Drs. Glick and Ellman, who are willing to venture beyond the lab and apply their skills to significant problems in human health,\" says John M. Schwab, a program director at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which supported the research. \"At the same time, it shows that clinicians and patients can benefit by including a chemical or molecular perspective in thinking about how to combat a complex, life-threatening disease.\"\\nWorking with a compound that belongs to one of the most well-studied families of drugs---the benzodiazepines---is remarkably helpful in moving Bz-423 into clinical trials, because so much is already known about chemical and pharmacological properties of that group, Glick says. Although Bz-423 is structurally similar to anti-anxiety drugs such as Valium and Xanax, subtle structural differences give it some advantages. For example, Bz-423 does not cause drowsiness or lead to addiction, says Glick.\\nAfter completing additional research on Bz-423, Glick plans to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to test the compound in humans. The University of Michigan has applied for several patents on the medical and pharmacological properties of the compound and its molecular target.\\nIn addition to Glick and Opipari, authors of the paper include M.D.-Ph.D. students Neal B.

That\\'s according to a new study published in the August 25, 2021, online issue of\\n\"Dementia risk scores might be useful to help identify people at higher risk of dementia earlier, so that potential lifestyle factors can be addressed earlier and monitored more closely,\" said study author Sebastian Köhler PhD, of Maastricht University, the Netherlands. \"Our study found that a substantial proportion of brain changes might be attributable to risk factors that can be modified.\"\\nThe study involved 4,164 people with an average age of 59. All participants took a test called the \"Lifestyle for Brain Health\" (LIBRA). The total score reflects a person\\'s potential for developing dementia. This study took into account 11 out of 12 lifestyle factors on the test, including high blood pressure, heart disease, smoking, diet and physical activity. Higher scores reflect higher dementia risk, with scores ranging from -2.7 to +12.7. Overall, the study group had an average score of 1.19. Researchers divided the participants into three groups: those with low risk of dementia, with an average score of -1.47, those with medium risk, with an average score of 1.20, and those with high risk, with an average score of 4.6.\\nParticipants in the study took tests of memory and other thinking skills, such as information processing speed, executive function and attention. Researchers also looked at brain scans for signs of cerebral small vessel disease, which are signs of vascular brain damage often seen in patients who have dementia. They also looked for changes in volumes of white matter and gray matter.\\nResearchers found that people who were in the high-risk group on the LIBRA test, indicating a less brain-healthy lifestyle, had higher volumes of brain lesions, 1.27 ml compared to 0.48 ml for those in the lowest risk group. The high-risk group also had lower scores on two tests of thinking: information processing speed and executive function and attention.\\nOnly in men, however, did researchers find associations between higher scores on the LIBRA test and lower volumes of grey matter, as well as lower scores on tests of memory.\\n\"More research is needed to confirm these findings and determine why there were differences between men and women,\" Köhler said. \"It\\'s exciting that a simple test score may indeed be an index of brain health. We need to learn whether people can improve their scores by making changes in their diet, increasing physical activity or limiting alcohol to low-to-moderate use.\"\\nThe study does not prove that lifestyle test scores predict dementia, it only shows an association.\\nThe study was supported by the European Regional Development Fund, the Province of Limburg, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, the Weijerhorst Foundation, the Pearl String Diabetes Initiative, Maastricht University, the Annadal Foundation and Health Foundation Limburg, all in the Netherlands.\\nA new study by UC Davis researchers provides evidence that methods using human bone marrow-derived stem cells to deliver gene therapy to cure diseases of the blood, bone marrow and certain types of cancer do not cause the development of tumors or leukemia.\\n\"The results of our decade-long study of adult human stem cell transplantation shows that there is little risk of adverse events caused by gene transfer, and that adult human stem cells do not pose a cancer risk when implanted into different organs,\" said Jan Nolta, senior author of the study and director of the UC Davis Stem Cell Program.\\nNolta and her colleagues tested the safety of gene transfer into bone marrow stem cells from human donors in more than 600 mice. None of the transplanted mice developed leukemia or solid tumors caused by the gene therapy treatment, during the evaluation period of up to 18 months.\\n\"These data are critical for advancing stem cell research leading toward therapies,\" Nolta said. \"We\\'ve shown that adult stem cells follow natural cues to reach target locations, they function normally when they get there and do not exhibit the unchecked cell growth that is the hallmark of cancer.\"\\nGene therapy trials using human bone marrow cells began in the early 1990s and have since included roughly 1,000 patients worldwide. In 2000, a leukemia-like condition emerged in three participants in a clinical trial in France, halting the trial and calling into question the safety of the method. Researchers suspected that the gene transferred in this trial gave the transplanted cells an enhanced growth capacity that led to the cancers.\\n\"After those studies in France, the gene therapy community felt that further biosafety testing was warranted,\" explained Gerhard Bauer, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of hematology and oncology. \"Due to the significantly large number of study animals, our investigation further illuminates the safety of gene therapy using hematopoietic stem cells. It allows us to rest easier with the knowledge that if we insert corrective genes into human bone marrow stem cells and administer those cells to human patients, we are providing a relatively safe therapy.\"\\nToday, gene therapy using the adult blood-forming cells found in bone marrow (known as hematopoietic stem cells) is normally done in an autologous transplant setting. The therapy involves taking hematopoietic stem cells from a person who needs treatment, genetically modifying the cells — perhaps by adding a missing gene — and then re-inserting the cells back into the same person. This treatment eliminates the complications of graft-versus-host disease or host rejection that can occur in allogeneic transplants (therapy where the cell donor is different from the recipient).\\nIn the current study, 630 immunodeficient mice received mesenchymal stem cells from one human bone marrow donor and hematopoietic stem cells from another. Mesenchymal stem cells are a type of cell found in bone marrow that support the function of hematopoietic stem cells, and can give rise to bone, cartilage, fat, and muscle. Genes were inserted into the hematopoietic stem cells using one of two viral vectors — either a retrovirus or a lentivirus — before they were transplanted into the mice, along with genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells.\\nOf the mice used in the long-term study, four developed human leukemia. None of those mice, however, were found to have vector DNA present in the malignant cells.\\n\"This is evidence of a natural tendency for human bone marrow stem cells to develop leukemia in long-term studies, not that the leukemia was caused by the genetic modification,\" Bauer explained. \"It\\'s a good statistical control for our method.\"\\nBauer noted that while the current study results are important for use with adult stem cells, they are not applicable to human embryonic stem cells, which have completely different properties.\\n\"Our experiments did not involve human embryonic stem cells, so we have a lot of stringent work to do to ensure that those types of stem cells can be used safely for human clinical trials,\" said Bauer. \"It certainly is possible, and we are working hard to establish safe and effective human embryonic stem cell-based cures for patients as well.\"\\nNolta and Bauer have worked on eighteen cell and gene therapy clinical therapy trials during their 12 years as colleagues, including stem cell gene therapy trials for adenosine deaminase deficiency, also known as the \"Bubble Boy Disease,\" and stem cell gene therapy for HIV, with colleagues from Children\\'s Hospital Los Angeles, who are also co-authors on the current report.\\nBauer is the director of UC Davis\\' Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) laboratory in Sacramento. Upon its completion, UC Davis will be one of the few universities with a large GMP facility where scientists will work in an ultra-clean environment to derive cellular products that, after certification and extensive testing, will be used to treat patients. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has recommended funding for this new facility to help bring a wide range of stem cell therapy cures to patients throughout California.\\nAccording to Nolta, the results of the current study will allow UC Davis to move forward with increased certainty as it prepares for clinical trials.\\n\"We are ready to further develop and test this safe approach to creating effective therapies, and are also using the same model to test the safety of embryonic stem cell-based therapies to fulfill the promise of regenerative medicine.\" she said.\\nThe study was published online in the May 6, 2008 issue of Molecular Therapy.\\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; The John Connell Gene Therapy Foundation; a Career Development Award from the Children\\'s Hospital of Los Angeles Research Institute, and UC Davis Stem Cell Program start-up funding.\\nNew research has found that positive community action can boost fish numbers in coral reefs and safeguard fish numbers there in the future.\\nThe research collaboration, which included academics from Swansea University\\'s College of Science, published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The paper details the social and ecological outcomes of the work being done in the Muluk and Wadau communities on Karkar Island, Papua New Guinea since 2001.\\nWhile coral reefs provide food and income for millions of people, reef health is declining worldwide, but these communities have established a traditional system of rotational fishing closures to manage their fisheries resources.\\nThe communities ban fishing on part of their reefs for a few years, and open these closures when village elders and fishers believe that fishes have changed their behaviour and fish populations have recovered.\\nThey then close a different part of their reef, and repeat the process. The researchers found that these practices resulted in more than twice as much fish on the closed reefs compared to open ones, and closures made fish less scared of people and easier to catch.\\nThe local people saw the closure system as good for their livelihoods and each period of closure was celebrated with a feast which meant that closures were remembered positively by the community.\\nLead author, Professor Josh Cinner of James Cook University in Australia said: \"The communities use a carrot and stick approach to ensure everyone complies with the closures. If they follow the rules they earn the right to do a special type of night fishing called \\'bom bom\\', but if someone breaks these rules, they are publically shamed.\"\\n\"These incentives to follow the rules are complemented with strong leadership and decision-making processes that allow the whole community to get involved and have a say.\"\\nHowever the team did find that while the closures boosted the number of fish in the short term, it may not be enough to stop the overall impact of fishing. However the academics say that because the communities manage their reefs themselves they can shorten the period between closures which could lessen the impact on fish numbers.\\nSwansea University scientist, Dr Fraser Januchowski-Hartley said: \"Our findings also show that while rotational closure system may not work everywhere, there could be some lessons that can be transferred to other places. For example, by adopting a system of property rights, encouraging participation and creating social norms communities can encourage more pro-environmental practices in the future.\"\\nApproximately 99.9% of fish and shark species are \"cold-blooded,\" meaning their body tissues generally match the temperature of the water they swim in -- but researchers have just discovered the mighty basking shark is a one-in-a-thousand exception. Instead, these sharks keep the core regions of their bodies warmer than the water like the most athletic swimmers in the sea such as great white sharks, mako sharks and tuna.\\nThe latter examples are so-called \"regional endotherms\" and are all fast swimming, apex predators at the top of the food chain. Scientists have long reasoned that their ability to keep warm helped with this athletic predatory lifestyle, and that evolution had shaped their physiology to match their requirements.\\nHowever, an international team of researchers led by those from Trinity College Dublin, has now shown that gentle, plankton-feeding basking sharks are also regional endotherms despite having very different lifestyles to white sharks and tunas.\\nThis surprising discovery has implications for conservation, as well as raising a plethora of ecological and evolutionary questions.\\nHaley Dolton, PhD Candidate in Trinity\\'s School of Natural Sciences, was lead author of the study that has just been published in international journal, Endangered Species Research. She said:\\n\"The basking shark is a shining example of how little we know about shark species in general. That we still have lots to uncover about the second biggest fish in the world -- such a huge, charismatic animal that most people would recognise it -- just highlights the challenge facing researchers to gather what they can about species to aid in effective conservation strategies.\\nBasking sharks gained legal protection in Irish waters just last year, with the species having undergone significant population declines throughout the NE Atlantic in the last century. But they still face many challenges in the future.\\nHaley Doltonadded: \"Regional endotherms are thought to use more energy, and possibly respond differently to ocean warming than other fish species. So lots more work will need to be done to work out how these new findings regarding an endangered species might change previous assumptions about their metabolism or potential distribution shifts during our climate crisis, which is something marine biologists are focusing on as our planet and its seas continue to warm.\\n\"Hopefully this kind of research will continue the momentum needed to effectively protect these incredible animals in Irish waters and further afield.\"\\nTo make the discovery, the research team (including scientists from University of Pretoria, Marine Biological Association, Queen\\'s University Belfast, Zoological Society of London, University of Southampton, and Manx Basking Shark Watch) first undertook dissections of dead basking sharks that washed up in Ireland and the UK.\\nThey found that the sharks have cruise-swimming muscles located deep inside their bodies as seen in white sharks and tunas; in most fish this \"red\" muscle is instead found toward the outside of the animals.\\nThey also discovered basking sharks have strong muscular hearts that probably help generate high blood pressures and flows. Most fish species have relatively \"spongy\" hearts, whereas basking shark hearts are more typical of the regional endotherm species.\\nNext, the team designed a new low-impact tagging method to record body temperature of free-swimming basking sharks off the coast of Co Cork, Ireland. Researchers were able get close enough to 8 m basking sharks to safely deploy the tags, which recorded muscle temperature just under the skin for up to 12 hours before they automatically detached from the animals and were collected by the researchers.\\nThese tags revealed that basking shark muscles are consistently elevated above water temperatures, and to almost exactly the same extent as their regionally-endothermic predatory cousins.\\nNicholas Payne, Assistant Professor in Trinity\\'s School of Natural Sciences, was senior author of the study. He said:\\n\"These results cast an interesting new light on our perception of form versus function in fishes because until now we thought regional endothermy was only found in apex predatory species living at high positions in the marine food web.\\n\"Now we have found a species that grazes on tiny plankton but also shares those rather uncommon regional endotherm features, so we might have to adjust our assumptions about the advantages of such physiological innovations for these animals.\\n\"It\\'s a bit like suddenly finding that cows have wings.\"\\nAvalanching sand from dune faces in Death Valley National Park and the Mojave Desert can trigger loud, rumbling \"booming\" or short bursts of \"burping\" sounds -- behaving as a perfectly tuned musical instrument.\\nThis sound is persistent and the dunes \"sing\" in frequencies ranging from 70 to 105 Hertz, with higher harmonics. Prior to the onset of a nearly monotone booming, burps of sound of smaller amplitude occur over a significantly broader span of frequencies.\\nAs a group of researchers from California Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge report in AIP\\'s journal Physics of Fluids, from AIP Publishing, they discovered that the \"booming\" and \"burping\" correspond to the transmission of a class of different waves within the dune.\\n\"Intrigued by these odd sounds emanating from the dunes, Nathalie Vriend researched this phenomenon as a Ph.D. student at Caltech with Melany Hunt, a professor of mechanical engineering. They collaborated with Rob Clayton, a professor of geophysics and borrowed a variety of geophysical scientific instruments to go out and \"probe\" the dunes\\' acoustical mystery. Vriend has since moved to the University of Cambridge.\"\\n\"During approximately 25 individual summer field days, on very hot and sandy dunes in California, we probed booming dunes,\" Vriend said, \"and they slowly revealed their underlying physics to us.\"\\nThe group focused on discovering how, specifically, the booming and burping sounds travel through sand. \"We measured the wave propagation characteristics, which include the motion of grains and frequency and energy of the emitted sound. This, in turn, revealed that booming and burping are two different, but related, phenomena,\" she said.\\nTo do this, they used geophones to measure seismic vibrations within the ground, which are similar to microphones that pick up acoustical vibrations -- sound pressure -- in the air. \"The waves travelling through the dune move individual grains of sand, which exert a force on the geophone that we use for measurements,\" Vriend added.\\nIt turns out that \"burping sounds correspond to a surface Rayleigh wave, travelling radially along the surface of the dune in a nonlinear manner,\" noted Vriend. \"This means that relations between these properties are complicated because of the influence of individual grains.\"\\nThe loud booming sounds, she pointed out, originate from \"linear P-waves that travel volumetrically and are reflected from internal layers inside the actual dune.\"\\nThe group was somewhat surprised to learn that for both booming and burping, the surface and volumetric signals are present with their own characteristic features and properties -- but the dominant signals are different.\\nAnother revelation was being able to excite the natural dune resonance on one occasion by simply providing an \"impulse\" on the dune surface. \"A blow of a hammer on a plate triggered a natural resonance -- around the booming frequency -- inside the dune, which is something we\\'ve never seen described in literature,\" Vriend said.\\nSince the group\\'s study revealed that burping and booming emissions are different acoustic phenomena, governed by different physical principles, it may also help explain some differences in measurements and interpretations regarding singing sand dunes made during the past decade.\\n\"More broadly, seismic surveys for oilfield exploration or earthquake investigations tend to rely on length scales that are usually much larger than those used by our study,\" she added. \"Even if the study is done on a sandy substrate, the \\'effective medium\\' response is recorded and individual grain interactions aren\\'t usually relevant. Our work illustrates the dual behavior of wave propagation when scales are reduced to a length where small- and larger-scale wave propagation converge.\"\\nVriend is now a Royal Society Research Fellow within the Department of Applied Mathematical and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. Her research group is working on a variety of projects to probe and solve other mysteries of granular dynamics.\\nOne of these projects involves exploring \"the granular dynamics during avalanching and its influence on the origin of structure in sand dunes in greater detail,\" she said. \"Our recent work involves using field and laboratory techniques to probe natural avalanching and sorting on large desert dunes in Qatar.\"\\nA new paper by Crislyn D\\'Souza-Schorey, professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame, discusses the biology of tumor-derived microvesicles and their clinical application as circulating biomarkers. Microvesicles are membrane-bound sacs released by tumor cells and can be detected in the body fluids of cancer patients.\\nThe World Health Organization estimates that cancer will cause approximately 9 million deaths in 2015. The rising prevalence of the disease is a major factor that drives the growth of the oncology biomarkers market. Biomarkers can be defined as any biological, chemical or physical parameter that can be utilized as an indicator of physiological or disease status. Thus, biomarkers are useful in cancer screening and detection and drug design and also in boosting the effectiveness of cancer care by allowing physicians to tailor therapies for individual patients -- an approach known as personalized medicine.\\nThe new paper discusses the potential of microvesicles to present a combination of disease- and tissue-specific markers that would constitute a unique and identifiable biosignature for individual cancers.\\n\"As such, it would make their sampling over time a preferred method to monitor changes to the tumor in response to treatment, especially for tissues such as the ovary or pancreas, where repeated biopsies of these organs is impractical,\" D\\'Souza-Schorey said.\\nProfiling of microvesicles could form the basis of personalized, targeted cancer therapies, especially as more reliable and rapid profiling technologies become available.\\n\"For example, certain markers like HER2/neu, in addition to being elevated in breast cancer, is also increased in a relatively smaller subset of other cancers such as ovarian cancer,\" D\\'Souza-Schorey said. \"This latter group of patients would benefit from existing treatment strategies that target the HER2 receptor.\"\\nThe approach could be advantageous over currently used approaches of profiling whole tissue or un-fractionated body fluid particularly if circulating microvesicles indeed concentrate molecular changes that occur in the tumor, as it would increase the sensitivity of detecting critical markers of cancer progression.\\n\"One complicating factor, though, is the presence of shed vesicles from other non-tumor cell types also in direct contact with these body fluids,\" D\\'Souza-Schorey said. \"Thus, equally significant is the development of strategies to selectively capture tumor-specific markers that separate from other shed vesicle populations.\"\\nIn collaboration with local oncologists, the D\\'Souza-Schorey laboratory is investigating the potential of microvesicles as a cancer diagnostic platform, a project under the umbrella of Notre Dame\\'s Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics Initiative. The lab\\'s research on the biology of microvesicles and their roles in tumor progression is supported by the National Cancer Institute and the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.\\n\"Despite considerable strides, effort and investment in cancer biomarker research in the past decade, there are still more desirable outcomes, most especially enhanced sensitivity to enable early detection,\" D\\'Souza-Schorey said. \"An effective biomarker platform that will overcome these challenges would be paradigm-shifting in cancer care.\"\\nThe paper, which appears in the June 15 issue of the journal Genes and Development, was coauthored by Notre Dame graduate student James Clancy.\\nA new once-weekly basal insulin injection demonstrated similar efficacy and safety and a lower rate of low blood sugar episodes compared with a daily basal insulin, according to a phase 2 clinical trial. The study results, which will be presented at ENDO 2021, the Endocrine Society\\'s annual meeting, compared an investigational drug called basal insulin Fc (BIF) with insulin degludec, a commercially available long-lasting daily insulin, in patients with type 2 diabetes.\\n\"These study results demonstrate that BIF has promise as a once-weekly basal insulin and could be an advancement in insulin therapy,\" said Juan Frias, M.D., the study\\'s principal investigator and the medical director of the National Research Institute in Los Angeles, Calif.\\nThe reduced number of injections with weekly insulin may improve adherence to insulin therapy, which could result in better patient outcomes than for daily basal insulins, Frias said. Once-weekly dosing also may increase the willingness of patients with type 2 diabetes to start insulin therapy when oral medication alone no longer gives adequate blood glucose control, he added.\\nThe 32-week clinical trial was conducted in 399 patients and sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company. All patients had type 2 diabetes and were previous users of basal insulin combined with oral antidiabetic medications.\\nThe patients received random assignments to one of three treatment groups: once-weekly injections of BIF at one of two different dosing algorithms (with different goals for fasting blood glucose levels) or the standard once-daily injections of insulin degludec. One fasting glucose target for patients receiving BIF was 140 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or less, and the other was at or below 120 mg/dL. The fasting glucose target for insulin degludec was 100 mg/dL or less.\\nCompared with insulin degludec, patients taking BIF achieved similar long-term blood glucose control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c, the researchers reported. Study participants had an average A1c of 8.1 percent at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study had an average improvement in A1c of 0.6 percent for BIF and 0.7 percent for insulin degludec, the data showed.\\nAdditionally, BIF use resulted in significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar (less than 70 mg/dL). Severe untreated hypoglycemia is a dangerous complication that can cause seizures, loss of consciousness and death. Frias said BIF has \"the potential of a flatter and more predictable action than the current daily basal insulins, which may have contributed to the lower rates of hypoglycemia.\"\\nRegarding safety, BIF had a generally comparable adverse event profile to that of insulin degludec, he said.\\n\"Based on our promising data, further research with BIF has been initiated in patients with type 1 diabetes and other type 2 diabetes patient populations,\" Frias said.\\nOrgan transplant recipients are twice as likely to develop melanoma as people who do not undergo a transplant, and three times more likely to die of the dangerous skin cancer, suggests new research led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health student.\\nThe findings, reported Aug. 13 in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, suggest that the immunosuppressive medications that transplant recipients receive to keep them from rejecting their new organs -- especially the high doses administered at the time of transplant -- may make them more susceptible to later stage cancers that are harder to cure. The researchers found that transplant recipients were four times more likely to be diagnosed with regional stage melanoma, which has already begun to spread to other parts of the body.\\n\"We knew that melanoma was more likely in transplant recipients, but we thought it might be a function of intensive screening since they are very likely to develop less deadly forms of skin cancer and are checked regularly by dermatologists,\" says Hilary A. Robbins, MSPH, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School who conducted much of the research while working at the National Cancer Institute. \"To the contrary, we were surprised to see that transplant recipients were particularly at risk for developing melanomas that weren\\'t found until they had already spread.\"\\nThe researchers were also surprised to see that the risk of aggressive melanomas was especially increased within the first four years after transplant. Previously, they thought that immunosuppressant medications might act cumulatively and that these cancers would be more likely after many years of taking the drugs. Transplant patients must take immunosuppressant medications for the rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection.\\nIn 2011, there were more than 65,000 cases of melanoma in the United States, making it the deadliest form of skin cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Melanoma can spread to other parts of the body and causes over 9,000 deaths every year. It is most commonly linked to exposure to the ultraviolet rays given off by the sun.\\nSome types of cancer are more common among immune-suppressed people, such as those infected with HIV and transplant recipients. But Robbins says these are typically cancers that are linked to viruses like cervical cancer, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and lymphoma. Melanoma is not linked to a virus.\\nFor their research, Robbins and the team studied 139,991 non-Hispanic white transplant recipients in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, which is led by Eric A. Engels, MD, MPH, a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute. The study links the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, which captures data on all transplants in the United States, with 15 population-based cancer registries, and includes information on almost half of the country\\'s transplant population between 1987 and 2010. The researchers found 519 melanomas in this group and analyzed risk factors for developing melanoma.\\nUsing a different data set, the researchers compared outcomes among 182 melanoma patients in the transplant group with more than 130,000 other people with melanoma. Over 15 years, 27 percent of the transplant recipients died of their melanoma, as compared to 12 percent of the non-recipients. The researchers found that melanoma patients who had received a transplant were three times more likely to die from their melanoma, even for melanomas that were diagnosed at an early stage or were very small.\\nThe researchers found that the late-stage cases of melanoma were associated with use of medication given at the time of transplant that essentially stops T-cells -- the main cells of immune response -- from functioning in order to keep them from attacking the new organ. Meanwhile, early-stage melanomas were more likely to be found in recipients who were administered a medication called azathioprine, a maintenance drug given long term to some transplant recipients. This drug is known to multiply the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to the development of melanoma.\\nRobbins says her group\\'s findings suggest that transplant candidates should be screened very carefully for skin cancers before receiving their transplant. She says it is possible that some of the melanomas could have been present at the time of transplant, but that immunosuppressive drugs allowed them to spread unchecked. She also says that closer monitoring after transplant could allow melanoma to be detected earlier, preventing patients from developing deadly metastatic cancer.\\nMany researchers are working to develop transplant protocols that reduce or even eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications, as these make organ recipients more likely to develop other medical problems.\\nOrgan transplant recipients are twice as likely to develop melanoma as people who do not undergo a transplant, and three times more likely to die of the dangerous skin cancer, suggests new research led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health student.\\nThe findings, reported Aug. 13 in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, suggest that the immunosuppressive medications that transplant recipients receive to keep them from rejecting their new organs -- especially the high doses administered at the time of transplant -- may make them more susceptible to later stage cancers that are harder to cure.

This drug is known to multiply the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to the development of melanoma.\\nRobbins says her group\\'s findings suggest that transplant candidates should be screened very carefully for skin cancers before receiving their transplant. She says it is possible that some of the melanomas could have been present at the time of transplant, but that immunosuppressive drugs allowed them to spread unchecked. She also says that closer monitoring after transplant could allow melanoma to be detected earlier, preventing patients from developing deadly metastatic cancer.\\nMany researchers are working to develop transplant protocols that reduce or even eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications, as these make organ recipients more likely to develop other medical problems.\\nUsing publicly available tourist photos of world landmarks such as the Trevi Fountain in Rome or Top of the Rock in New York City, Cornell University researchers have developed a method to create maneuverable 3D images that show changes in appearance over time.\\nThe method, which employs deep learning to ingest and synthesize tens of thousands of mostly untagged and undated photos, solves a problem that has eluded experts in computer vision for six decades.\\n\"It\\'s a new way of modeling scenes that not only allows you to move your head and see, say, the fountain from different viewpoints, but also gives you controls for changing the time,\" said Noah Snavely, associate professor of computer science at Cornell Tech and senior author of \"Crowdsampling the Plenoptic Function,\" presented at the European Conference on Computer Vision, held virtually Aug. 23-28.\\n\"If you really went to the Trevi Fountain on your vacation, the way it would look would depend on what time you went -- at night, it would be lit up by floodlights from the bottom. In the afternoon, it would be sunlit, unless you went on a cloudy day,\" Snavely said. \"We learned the whole range of appearances, based on time of day and weather, from these unorganized photo collections, such that you can explore the whole range and simultaneously move around the scene.\"\\nRepresenting a place in a photorealistic way is challenging for traditional computer vision, partly because of the sheer number of textures to be reproduced. \"The real world is so diverse in its appearance and has different kinds of materials -- shiny things, water, thin structures,\" Snavely said.\\nAnother problem is the inconsistency of the available data. Describing how something looks from every possible viewpoint in space and time -- known as the plenoptic function -- would be a manageable task with hundreds of webcams affixed around a scene, recording data day and night. But since this isn\\'t practical, the researchers had to develop a way to compensate.\\n\"There may not be a photo taken at 4 p.m. from this exact viewpoint in the data set. So we have to learn from a photo taken at 9 p.m. at one location, and a photo taken at 4:03 from another location,\" Snavely said. \"And we don\\'t know the granularity of when these photos were taken. But using deep learning allows us to infer what the scene would have looked like at any given time and place.\"\\nThe researchers introduced a new scene representation called Deep Multiplane Images to interpolate appearance in four dimensions -- 3D, plus changes over time. Their method is inspired in part on a classic animation technique developed by the Walt Disney Company in the 1930s, which uses layers of transparencies to create a 3D effect without redrawing every aspect of a scene.\\n\"We use the same idea invented for creating 3D effects in 2D animation to create 3D effects in real-world scenes, to create this deep multilayer image by fitting it to all these disparate measurements from the tourists\\' photos,\" Snavely said. \"It\\'s interesting that it kind of stems from this very old, classic technique used in animation.\"\\nIn the study, they showed that this model could be trained to create a scene using around 50,000 publicly available images found on sites such as Flickr and Instagram. The method has implications for computer vision research, as well as virtual tourism -- particularly useful at a time when few can travel in person.\\n\"You can get the sense of really being there,\" Snavely said. \"It works surprisingly well for a range of scenes.\"\\nFirst author of the paper is Cornell Tech doctoral student Zhengqi Li. Abe Davis, assistant professor of computer science in the Faculty of Computing and Information Science, and Cornell Tech doctoral student Wenqi Xian also contributed.\\nThe research was partly supported by philanthropist Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, and Wendy Schmidt, by recommendation of the Schmidt Futures Program.\\nAmericans are eating safer.  The number of people who reported eating one or more foods associated with an increased risk of foodborne disease declined by a third from 1998 to 2002, according to survey results released today at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases.\\n\"Overall we are seeing a decline in risky food consumption and that may be attributable to published media reports of foodborne outbreaks and outreach efforts by the public health community,\" says Erica Weis of the California Department of Health Services, the lead author on the study.\\nWeis and her colleagues compared data from two Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) telephone surveys conducted in 1998 and 2002, in which subjects were asked about foods they had consumed in the previous week.  Specifically they looked at whether the subject had consumed one of 7 \"risky foods\" known to be associated with an increased risk of foodborne illness:\\nIn 1998, 31% of those surveyed said that they had consumed one or more risky foods in the previous week.  By 2002, that number had dropped to 21%.  The most commonly reported risky food item consumed was runny eggs.\\nMen aged 18-64 were more likely to report consuming risky foods than women of the same age group (38% vs. 30%) and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely to consume risky foods than whites (32% vs. 21%).  The safest eaters were African Americans, only 15% of whom reported consuming one or more risky foods in the 2002 survey.\\nAmong subjects under the age of 18, those who were immunocompromised were much more likely to consume risky foods compared to healthy subjects (21% vs. 14%).\\n\"Consumption of risky foods declined significantly in 2002 compared to 1998.  However, in the future there needs to be more targeted outreach to those groups that continue to have high levels of risky food consumption,\" says Weis. The research was conducted by a working group that included investigators from the California Department of Health Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Connecticut Emerging Infections Program, the Georgia Division of Public Health, the Tennessee Department of Health and the Oregon Department of Human Services.\\nNo matter whether it\\'s a drill or an oscillator, handheld power tools produce powerful vibrations. But a new anti-vibration system almost entirely eliminates that uncomfortable shaking sensation you get when using such tools: The FEIN MultiMaster oscillator vibrates up to 70 percent less and is only half as loud as its predecessor. Fraunhofer researchers developed the technology in collaboration with FEIN and will be presenting the system at Hannover Messe (Hall 2, Booth C22) from April 13 to 17, 2015.\\nIf you\\'ve spent extended periods of time working with a drill or some other handheld power tool, you\\'ll know how quickly you\\'re longing to give your poor arms a rest. No wonder, either -- such devices tend to vibrate a lot and be very loud. In the future, you\\'ll experience far lower vibrations when you want to drill, saw or sand something. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF in Darmstadt teamed up with their colleagues at C. & E. Fein GmbH to develop a technology to dramatically reduce vibrations. \"We examined how the system is set up and refined it so it can be applied to a range of handheld power tools,\" explains Heiko Atzrodt, group manager at Fraunhofer LBF. And this is precisely what FEIN has done to one of its oscillating power tools -- in other words, a tool that doesn\\'t have a rotating action, but rather one that moves back and forth almost 19,500 times a minute. These and similar tools can do more than saw and sand; they are just as adept at rasping, polishing, shaving, cutting, severing, sharpening and filing -- including at those hard-to-reach places.\\nDecoupling the housing from the motor\\nSo how did the researchers manage to dramatically reduce how much handheld power tools vibrate? \"Elastomer elements are used to decouple the housing from the motor and act like a form of mechanical suspension and insulation,\" says Atzrodt. What this means is that only a tiny portion of motor vibrations are transferred to the housing and so to the user. You can, however, have too much of a good thing: If the researchers were to insulate the housing too much, users would be unable to feel how hard they were pressing the tool onto whatever material they\\'re working with. So the researchers had to strike a balance between reducing vibrations and allowing users to retain a feel for what the tool is doing. This comes down to adjusting the stiffness of the elastomer elements. First, the researchers used a simulation to determine the ideal stiffness range before integrating various suspension and insulation devices into a test system. This in turn allowed them to set the basic development parameters.\\nUp to 70 percent lower vibrations, 50 percent less noise\\n\"By applying the anti-vibration system, FEIN was able to reduce vibrations by up to 70 percent compared to previous models,\" says Atzrodt. \"For almost all applications, the oscillator now belongs squarely in the zero vibration class.\" Since this makes it permissible to work with this tool for up to eight hours at a time, technicians or autoworkers can now use it throughout their shift. The tool is also easier on the ears: Thanks to the new insulation, it now produces 50 percent less acoustic pressure.\\nThis low-vibration oscillator is now on the market under the name FEIN MultiMaster FMM 350 Q. At Hannover Messe, the Fraunhofer LBF researchers will be offering visitors the chance to feel the difference for themselves by demonstrating the new-and-improved oscillator next to its predecessor.\\nExtermination of dingoes and the consequent loss of small mammals -- not just overgrazing by livestock -- have led to a rapid spread of woody shrubs across semi-arid Australia, a new study shows.\\nRe-introduction of small mammals to desert areas could help prevent further invasion by the woody weeds, the researchers suggest.\\nThe study in outback NSW compared conditions on either side of the dingo fence -- a two-metre tall, 5600-kilometre long fence erected more than a century ago to keep dingoes out of eastern Australia.\\nDingoes are common on the western side of the fence, but rare on the other side, due to intensive control measures including poisoning, trapping and shooting over many decades.\\n\"Woody shrubs pose a major problem for farmers and their abundance in semi-arid areas has risen dramatically in recent decades,\" says study senior author UNSW Associate Professor Mike Letnic.\\n\"These weeds reduce the availability of feed for livestock and hinder access for mustering. But removing them is contentious, because they are classified as native vegetation.\"\\nTo measure the encroachment of woody shrubs into grasslands, the researchers, led by PhD candidate Christopher Gordon from Western Sydney University, examined aerial photographs of far western NSW and eastern South Australia spanning a 50 year period.\\nThey assessed four sites in the Strzelecki Desert, two on either side of the dingo fence. The results are published in the Journal of Animal Ecology.\\n\"The fence provides a rare, large-scale natural experiment to examine the effects that a top predator such as the dingo has on ecosystems,\" says Dr Gordon.\\n\"We found that shrub cover had increased on the dingo-free side in both areas, one that had been used for livestock grazing and one that had not been grazed since the 1970s. This suggests overgrazing by livestock may not be the main cause of shrub spread, as had been thought.\\n\"There was also a negligible increase in shrub cover in comparable areas on the other side of the fence, which suggests dingoes help reduce shrub spread,\" he says.\\nThis led the team to investigate the activity of small mammals and they found they were more common in areas where the shrubs were sparse. They also looked in detail at the feeding habits of one small mammal, the dusky hopping mouse, and found it consumed significant amounts of woody shrub seeds.\\nThe rate of survival of shrub seedlings was greater in areas where dingoes were rare and the rate of removal of seeds was lower there.\\n\"Taken together, our results suggest a cascading effect. A loss of dingoes allows foxes and feral cats to thrive and prey on the small mammals that eat the shrub seeds. Fewer small mammals means the shrubs can spread,\" says Gordon.\\n\"This is the first study to link shrub encroachment to loss of an apex predator like the dingo, and it could explain shrub spread in many other areas around the globe.\\n\"Rewilding initiatives that aim to conserve or re-establish small mammal populations could help stop the invasion of these pervasive weeds in Australia,\" he says.\\nThe aerial photographs were collected by government agencies in 1948, 1972, 1983 and 1999. Shrub cover was 26-48 per cent greater in areas where dingoes were rare compared with areas where they were common.\\nNear real-time analysis of the April 1 earthquake in Iquique, Chile, showed that the 8.2 event occurred in a gap on the fault unruptured since 1877 and that the April event was not what the scientists had expected, according to an international team of geologists.\\n\"We assumed that the area of the 1877 earthquake would eventually rupture, but all indications are that this 8.2 event was not the 8.8 event we were looking for,\" said Kevin P. Furlong, professor of geophysics, Penn State. \"We looked at it to see if this was the big one.\"\\nBut according to the researchers, it was not. Seismologists expect that areas of faults will react the same way over and over. However, the April earthquake was about nine times less energetic than the one in 1877 and was incapable of releasing all the stress on the fault, leaving open the possibility of another earthquake.\\nThe Iquique earthquake took place on the northern portion of the subduction zone formed when the Nazca tectonic plate slides under the South American plate. This is one of the longest uninterrupted plate boundaries on the planet and the site of many earthquakes and volcanos. The 8.2 earthquake was foreshadowed by a systematic sequence of foreshocks recorded at 6.0, 6.5, 6.7 and 6.2 with each foreshock triggering the next until the main earthquake occurred.\\nThese earthquakes relieved the stresses on some parts of the fault. Then the 8.2 earthquake relieved more stress, followed by a series of aftershocks in the range of 7.7. While the aftershocks did fill in some of the gaps left by the 8.2 earthquake, the large earthquake and aftershocks could not fill in the entire gap where the fault had not ruptured in a very long time. That area is unruptured and still under stress.\\nThe foreshocks eased some of the built up stress on 60 to 100 miles of fault, and the main shock released stress on about 155 miles, but about 155 miles of fault remain unchanged, the researchers report today (Aug. 13) in Nature.\\n\"There can still be a big earthquake there,\" said Furlong. \"It didn\\'t release the total hazard, but it told us something about this large earthquake area. That an 8.8 rupture doesn\\'t always happen.\"\\nThe researchers were able to do this analysis in near real time because of the availability of large computing power and previously laid groundwork.\\nThe computing power allowed researchers to model the fault more accurately. In the past, subduction zones were modeled as if they were on a plane, but the plate that is subducting curves underneath the other plate creating a 3-dimensional fault line. The researchers used a model that accounted for this curving and so more accurately recreated the stresses on the real geology at the fault.\\n\"One of the things the U.S. Geological Survey and we have been doing is characterizing the major tectonic settings,\" said Furlong. \"So when an earthquake is imminent, we don\\'t need a lot of time for the background.\"\\nIn essence, they are creating a library of information about earthquake faults and have completed the first level, a general set of information on areas such as Japan, South America and the Caribbean. Now they are creating the levels of north and south Japan or Chile, Peru and Ecuador.\\nKnowing where the old earthquake occurred, how large it was and how long ago it happened, the researchers could look at the foreshocks, see how much stress they relieved and anticipate, at least in a small way, what would happen.\\n\"This is what we need to do in the future in near real time for decision makers,\" said Furlong.\\nKidney transplant patients appear to be at a greater risk of developing melanoma than the general population and risk factors include being older, male and white, findings that corroborate results demonstrated in other studies, according to a new article published by\\nLifelong immunosuppressive therapy is among the complex lifestyle changes faced by renal transplant patients.

Researchers found that the rates of self-reported eating disorders were highest in transgender people. Heterosexual men had the lowest rates.\\n\"Transgender people were more likely to report a diagnosis of an eating disorder -- bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa -- in the past year,\" said senior author Alexis Duncan, PhD, assistant professor at the Brown School. \"They also reported using vomiting, laxatives or diet pills more for weight control in the past 30 days than cisgender men and women, regardless of their sexual orientation.\"\\nThe ACHA-NCHA survey, the authors wrote in the study, \"includes the largest number of transgender participants ever to be surveyed about eating disorders and compensatory behaviors, thus enabling us to conduct statistically powerful analyses of the relationship between gender identity, sexual orientation and eating-related pathology.\"\\nThe results were published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in April. Elizabeth W. Diemer, who graduated in 2014 with a bachelor\\'s degree in psychology in Arts & Sciences, was first author on the study.\\nThe students self-reported their mental health, substance use, sexual behavior and nutrition history on questionnaires distributed between 2008-2011.\\nOf the ACHA-NCHA survey data, 268,066 students self identified as heterosexual, 5,057 as unsure, 15,422 as bisexual, lesbian or gay, and 479 as transgender.\\nTransgender students were found to have significantly greater odds of past-year eating disorder diagnosis, past-month diet pill use and past-month vomiting or laxative use compared to cisgender heterosexual women.\\nTransgender participants also were significantly more likely than members of any other group, including cisgender sexual minorities, to report past-year eating disorder diagnosis and past-month compensatory behaviors.\\n\"I don\\'t think that this is particularly surprising to the LGBTQ community and/or to clinicians that work with members of this community,\" Duncan said. \"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence of eating disorders among transgender people; however, there have been few previous studies that have compared transgender people to cisgender people, and to our knowledge, no single previous study has compared transgender people to both cisgender heterosexual and sexual minority individuals.\"\\nEach year, about 80,000 people in Germany become seriously ill from occlusions of veins caused by blood clots. Such thromboses can cause pulmonary embolism or even heart attacks. Even airline passengers at long distance flights can be affected by deep vein thrombosis. But with the new system, a fast and easy test of a risk of travel-related thrombosis will soon be possible.\\nAirline passengers would only have to relinquish one drop of blood to the measuring device. The special feature of this miniscale lab-on-a-chip: the system is designed in plastic for an inexpensive production, sheets or reel-to-reel. This would facilitate cost-efficient manufacturing of disposable diagnostic systems. Such tiny analysis systems are still science fiction. In the EU project DVT-Imp, researchers from eight European countries are developing essential foundations for the laboratory on the plastic chip.\\n\"This example shows clearly the possibilities for polytronics. In a networked world, oriented towards people, inexpensive, multifunctional systems are needed -- for example in Assisted Living. In order to build up the infrastructure necessary for this, electronic systems have to be produced in large quantities, in a cost-effective manner on large substrates. And with polymer electronics, this would be perfectly possible,\" says Prof. Karlheinz Bock, head of the \"Polytronic Systems\" division at IZM. Polytronic, resp. polymer electronics, is a key technology that combines functional materials and electronics. A major advantage is the simple and inexpensive production: the polymer materials can be dissolved and then, like electronic ink, be recaptured through a printing process, structured on flexible sheets. \"In this manner, we can construct small, handy and easy-to-use systems that for the most part make life easier for the sick and elderly,\" explains Bock.\\nAssiduously at work on the engineering of the diagnostic systems for deep vein thrombosis are ten leading European research institutes and high tech firms. The core of the future analytical device, a lab-on-chip, was built and tested at IZM. It is a small, high-precision manufactured single-use cartridge that acts as a tool for the biochemical analysis of a drop of blood. It consists of a polycarbonate plate measuring 3 mm by 22 mm by 70 mm, and unites two critical components in one device: the most important component -- a foil of 150 micrometers thickness, on which a filigree network with conductor lines and gold sensors for blood analysis is attached, as well as a 120 micrometer deep fluid channel for conducting blood to the analysis elements. Inside the sensor chamber, the antibodies are integrated on electrodes that allow to analyze the concentration of blood clotting markers. If the number is elevated, then the risk of a thrombus -- i.e. a blood clot -- is forming.\\nBut this system can be an important life companion not only for thrombosis-prone passengers on long-distance flights or stroke patients, but also for smokers, pregnant women or the obese. They will no longer have to wait days for lab results on possible clot forming in their blood. Just like glucose tests, a drop of the patient\\'s blood suffices on the single-use cartridge the physician places then in a little hand-held scanner. Within minutes, the results appear on the display -- and, if necessary, immediately apply the according measures. The EU project on the feasibility of the system runs until the middle of this year.\\nThe sensor wristband -- also engineered at IZM -- is suited for the long-term monitoring of various important body functions of older patients -- but also of athletes. It is like a plastic wristwatch. Instead of a clock dial, the sensor wristband is equipped with an illuminated \"electroluminescent display\" that indicates for example the actual body temperature at any time of the day. It also detects skin moisture, which may be a sign for the dehydration of the patient or athlete. For a person with a pacemaker the patient wristband may also signal potential danger, indicating the strength of electric or electromagnetic fields in close proximity. A number of other applications are conceivable: if needed, the most diverse array of sensors can be integrated into the polytronic platform.\\nFrom a technical perspective, the sensory wristband is a combination of polymer and conventional electronics. Lighting elements, sensors and polymer resistances printed on the foils are connected into one system with integrated circuits made of silicon. A three micrometer-thin resonance circuit with an etched coil -- a kind of minute antenna -- records the electric smog. An interdigital capacitor attached to a foil and only 30 micrometers thick detects skin moisture. Comb-shaped, narrowly interlaced meanders made of copper bands of a mere 0.5 micrometer thickness, measure the body temperature.\\n\"The sensor wristband demonstrates the potential that lies within the flexible electronics mounted on foils,\" clarifies Prof. Bock. The tiny sensors and the optical functions are applied to the foils through a combination of technical printing and lithographic processes. The sensor wristband, just like the diagnostic device for deep vein thrombosis, can be manufactured cost-effectively both as individual sheets as well as by roll-to-roll production in larger batches.\\nResearchers from the University of Seville, in collaboration with the Genome Damage and Stability Centre of the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, have recently published a study in the review\\nMany types of DNA breaks are frequently produced in cells. Their correct repair is essential for the prevention of genome destabilisation, which can cause the development of diseases like cancer. In this project, a very specific type of chromosomal break was studied, which is produced during the expression of certain genes.\\n\"They are breaks generated by enzymes called DNA topoisomerases. Perhaps the most relevant is produced during the expression of some genes, those which then translocate,\" explains the study\\'s main author, the University of Seville researcher Dr Fernando Gómez Herreros.\\nIn this project, the experts describe how the specific repair mechanism of these breaks prevents the formation of some aberrant chromosomal structures called translocations. Translocations consist of complete chromosomal fragments that move from one part of the genome to another. \"These are the origin of solid tumours and leukemia, like secondary acute myeloid leukemia, therefore we suggest that the mechanism described in this project can be involved in preventing the formation of some types of cancer,\" adds Gómez Herreros.\\nThe formative years don\\'t stop at 18, according to a new study that found the actions and lifestyle of the family continue to influence whether young adults embrace their ethnicity and take pride in their roots.\\nPublished in the Journal of Adolescence, the study of young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 found that those whose families continue to teach them about their ethnic background had a greater sense of ethnic identity.\\nIndividuals whose families actively share cultural customs and traditions with them, celebrating Chinese New Year for example, reported feeling more attached to their ethnic group and spent more time exploring their heritage.\\n\"These results highlight the fact that cultural education is an important aspect of parenting,\" said the study\\'s author Linda Juang, associate professor of psychology at San Francisco State University. \"The influence of the family continues to shape young people\\'s ethnic identity beyond adolescence.\"\\nJuang surveyed more than 200 adults between the ages of 18 and 30, including Asian Americans, Latinos, white individuals and those of mixed ethnicity. Early adulthood is thought to be a critical time for identity development. Psychologists are interested in how ethnic identity is formed since research has associated a strong sense of ethnic identity with greater life satisfaction and decreased depression.\\nThe study found that the family\\'s role in communicating cultural practices and traditions had a greater influence on young adults\\' exploration of their ethnicity compared with whether they adopted values associated with their ethnic group. \"Parents may be effective in prompting their children to find out more about their culture but they can\\'t necessarily instill the values of their culture,\" Juang said.\\nThe results also suggest that the relationship between the family\\'s influence and ethnic identity is more pronounced for females than males. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that parents tend to focus on passing on cultural traditions to daughters more than sons.\\nThe study was recently published online in the Journal of Adolescence and will be published in the August 2010 print issue. Juang authored the study with former San Francisco State University graduate student Moin Syed.\\nOn water, on land, and in the air -- microorganisms are almost everywhere and are essential for all biogeochemical cycles on the planet. They are masters of degradation and transformation in water, soil -- and even our intestines. Whether in waste water treatment plants or industrial biotechnological processes (e.g. for the production of food, biogas, or bio-based plastics), we harness the productivity of complex microbial communities. The right conditions ensure that the microorganisms can carry out their respective functions. However, stable processes also require a stable composition of the microbial community. \"And that is precisely the challenge,\" says Prof. Susann Müller, who heads the Flow Cytometry working group at the UFZ Department of Environmental Microbiology. \"The problem with microbial communities is that they can suddenly develop in completely different directions -- even under the same conditions.\"\\nA minor random event can give rise to a completely different microbial community. And this can happen rather quickly when microorganisms grow exponentially. In addition, there is constant flow or mass transfer in bioreactors, which can be disastrous for some microorganisms. \"In microbial communities, there are also microorganisms that are present only in comparatively small numbers and which multiply slowly,\" says Müller. \"For example, the methane-forming microorganisms used in biogas production are indispensable for the desired processes. They have slower growth rates and come into play only at later stages. If the crucial microorganisms are inadvertently lost from the system, everything ultimately comes to a standstill.\" In order to prevent this, the UFZ research team has proposed a new method called \"mass transfer with a loop\" in a study recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). A kind of loop is built into the bioreactor system in order to stabilise the microbial community and prevent microbial groups from being lost from the system altogether. But how does it work? And how did the scientists go about it?\\nThey first created five bioreactors, each with identical microbial communities. They then investigated whether and to what extent the composition of these communities changed over time. To do this, they used high-throughput flow cytometry to quickly examine single cells and characterise them in detail. Various parameters of the bacteria such as cell size, cell density, and DNA content can be determined. A sample with 200,000 bacterial cells can thus be displayed as precisely as a fingerprint -- somewhat like a QR code -- within just a few minutes. Using special computer methods, the research team analysed the huge amounts of data generated and was thus able to detect changes in the microbial composition. \"As suspected, the microbial communities in the five bioreactors developed quite differently despite the identical conditions,\" says Müller. Next, the researchers introduced a loop into the system. This sixth bioreactor was connected to each of the five reactors via inflow and outflow. As a result, a constant exchange or mass transfer took place between the bioreactors. \"Our investigations showed that the microbial communities in the bioreactors were synchronised with each other by the loop and that their composition and functions were permanently stabilised,\" says Müller. \"In addition, the survival probability of micro-organisms with a low growth rate was considerably increased. This rescue effect can be crucial for many biotechnological processes.\"\\nThe effects of mass transfers are not new; they are known, among other things, from sewage treatment plants in which part of the settling sludge from the third treatment stage is transferred back to the second treatment stage. \"The principle was actually fairly obvious,\" says Müller. \"But, so far, no one had investigated this in depth. In our study, we designed a completely new reactor system and combined a wide range of disciplines such as microbiology, ecology, biotechnology, single cell analytics, data science, and modelling. We were thus able to show for the first time that the principle of mass transfer with a loop can stabilise microbial communities in the long term. We hope that with our study we can provide stimuli for practical application.\"\\n\\nAnswer the question based on the given passages and provide a complete reasoning process.\\nQuestion:Which transplant patients, heart or kidney, had a higher incidence of developing melanoma after their transplant and how does the treatment interval for kidney failure correspond to the risk of developing melanoma?\\nAnswer:',\n",
       " 'answer': 'Kidney transplant patients had a higher incidence of developing melanoma after their transplant compared to heart transplant patients. The incidence of melanoma in kidney transplant patients was 0.4 percent between 2004 and 2012, while heart transplant patients had only 1 case over 19 years, which is approximately 0.33 percent over the study period.

       "    'content': 'Many heart transplant patients develop multiple skin cancers, with increased risk for some skin cancers among patients with other cancers and with increasing age, according to a report in the December issue of\\n\"Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk for skin cancers,\" the authors write as background information in the article. \"Incidence, tumor burden and risk factors for skin cancer are well documented in renal transplant recipients. However, these characteristics are documented to a lesser extent in heart transplant patients, who are at least twice as likely to have skin cancer compared with renal transplant recipients.\" Reasons for this could include the greater use of immunosuppressive medications and an older average age at the time of transplant.\\nJerry D. Brewer, M.D., of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., and colleagues reviewed the records of 312 patients who had received heart transplants between 1988 and 2006. Patients had an average age of 47.4 years at the time of their transplant and information was extracted from their charts regarding overall characteristics, cancers, risk factors and death.\\nThe patients developed a total of 1,395 skin cancers; overall, 46.4 percent of the patients had developed skin cancer during the 19 years of follow-up. This included 1,236 squamous cell carcinomas and 151 basal cell carcinomas (the non-melanoma skin cancers), five malignant melanomas and three other types.\\nWhen evaluating the tumor burden of the 312 patients, 76 (24.4 percent) had at least one squamous cell carcinoma, 24 (7.7 percent) had only one squamous cell carcinoma and 19 (6.1 percent) had 10 or more; in addition, 54 (17.3 percent) had at least one basal cell carcinoma, 23 (7.4 percent) had only one and two (0.6 percent) had 10 or more.\\nPatients were more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma if they had other types of cancer after their transplant, were older or had a known cause for their heart failure. Infection with the herpes simplex virus, being older and using a medication known as mycophenolate to suppress the immune system were associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma.\\n\"Although a considerable tumor burden was found in this study, the rate of death due to skin cancer was surprisingly low. Only one patient died of skin cancer, of a melanoma,\" the authors write. \"Health care providers and patients at our center have been educated for more than 10 years about the risk, early detection and treatment of skin cancer, which is apparent from the low mortality rate seen in the patients of this study.\"\\n\"Vigilant sun protection practices, skin cancer education, regular skin examinations and daily vitamin D supplementation are appropriate interventions in these high-risk heart transplant patients,\" they conclude.'},\n",

The type, intensity and duration of immunosuppressive therapy contribute to the risk of developing skin cancer, such as melanoma, after transplantation.\\nIn the study, Mona Ascha, M.D., of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Ohio, and coauthors used a database of a group of renal transplant recipients from 2004 through 2012.

       "    'content': 'For patients with kidney failure, poor kidney function and immunosuppressant medications may increase their risk of developing different types of cancer. The findings, which are published in a study appearing in an upcoming issue of the\\nPeople with kidney failure are at increased risk of developing different types of cancer, which might be due to a variety of factors related to their disease and the treatments they receive. Often these patients undergo intervals of dialysis followed by transplantation, and then they return to dialysis if the transplant fails. Understanding how these different exposures correspond to cancer risk can help inform cancer prevention and screening decisions for patients and can provide insights into the underlying causes of cancer.\\nTo investigate, Elizabeth Yanik, PhD, ScM (National Cancer Institute) and her colleagues evaluated information on 202,195 kidney transplant candidates and recipients by linking the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to various US population-based cancer registries. For a number of cancers, the team observed clear patterns of risk that corresponded to different treatment intervals. For example, risk of kidney and thyroid cancers was high across all intervals, but the risk was particularly heightened when individuals were on dialysis. Conversely, risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, lung cancer, and certain skin cancers was highest following kidney transplantation and--for those who experienced it-- prior to transplant failure. This may have been due to the effects of immunosuppressant medications that are needed while living with a functioning kidney transplant.\\nThese findings reveal that kidney dysfunction and immunosuppressant medications can have important effects on cancer incidence in patients with kidney failure.\\n\"Our study indicates that the needs of individuals with end-stage renal disease, in terms of cancer prevention and cancer screening, will likely differ over time,\" said Dr. Yanik. \"Vigilance for kidney cancer and thyroid cancer may be of particular importance while these individuals are on dialysis. Extra consideration for screening for melanoma or lung cancer may be called for while taking immunosuppressant medications following a kidney transplant.\"\\nIn an accompanying editorial, Wai Lim, PhD (University of Western Australia) and Steven Chadban, PhD (University of Sydney) noted that \"the epidemiologic insights provided by Yanik et al. may have important implications for the pathogenesis and mechanism of cancer development in patients.\"'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Organ transplant recipients are twice as likely to develop melanoma as people who do not undergo a transplant, and three times more likely to die of the dangerous skin cancer, suggests new research led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health student.\\nThe findings, reported Aug. 13 in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, suggest that the immunosuppressive medications that transplant recipients receive to keep them from rejecting their new organs -- especially the high doses administered at the time of transplant -- may make them more susceptible to later stage cancers that are harder to cure. The researchers found that transplant recipients were four times more likely to be diagnosed with regional stage melanoma, which has already begun to spread to other parts of the body.\\n\"We knew that melanoma was more likely in transplant recipients, but we thought it might be a function of intensive screening since they are very likely to develop less deadly forms of skin cancer and are checked regularly by dermatologists,\" says Hilary A. Robbins, MSPH, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School who conducted much of the research while working at the National Cancer Institute. \"To the contrary, we were surprised to see that transplant recipients were particularly at risk for developing melanomas that weren\\'t found until they had already spread.\"\\nThe researchers were also surprised to see that the risk of aggressive melanomas was especially increased within the first four years after transplant. Previously, they thought that immunosuppressant medications might act cumulatively and that these cancers would be more likely after many years of taking the drugs. Transplant patients must take immunosuppressant medications for the rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection.\\nIn 2011, there were more than 65,000 cases of melanoma in the United States, making it the deadliest form of skin cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Melanoma can spread to other parts of the body and causes over 9,000 deaths every year. It is most commonly linked to exposure to the ultraviolet rays given off by the sun.\\nSome types of cancer are more common among immune-suppressed people, such as those infected with HIV and transplant recipients. But Robbins says these are typically cancers that are linked to viruses like cervical cancer, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and lymphoma. Melanoma is not linked to a virus.\\nFor their research, Robbins and the team studied 139,991 non-Hispanic white transplant recipients in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, which is led by Eric A. Engels, MD, MPH, a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute. The study links the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, which captures data on all transplants in the United States, with 15 population-based cancer registries, and includes information on almost half of the country\\'s transplant population between 1987 and 2010. The researchers found 519 melanomas in this group and analyzed risk factors for developing melanoma.\\nUsing a different data set, the researchers compared outcomes among 182 melanoma patients in the transplant group with more than 130,000 other people with melanoma. Over 15 years, 27 percent of the transplant recipients died of their melanoma, as compared to 12 percent of the non-recipients. The researchers found that melanoma patients who had received a transplant were three times more likely to die from their melanoma, even for melanomas that were diagnosed at an early stage or were very small.\\nThe researchers found that the late-stage cases of melanoma were associated with use of medication given at the time of transplant that essentially stops T-cells -- the main cells of immune response -- from functioning in order to keep them from attacking the new organ. Meanwhile, early-stage melanomas were more likely to be found in recipients who were administered a medication called azathioprine, a maintenance drug given long term to some transplant recipients. This drug is known to multiply the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to the development of melanoma.\\nRobbins says her group\\'s findings suggest that transplant candidates should be screened very carefully for skin cancers before receiving their transplant. She says it is possible that some of the melanomas could have been present at the time of transplant, but that immunosuppressive drugs allowed them to spread unchecked. She also says that closer monitoring after transplant could allow melanoma to be detected earlier, preventing patients from developing deadly metastatic cancer.\\nMany researchers are working to develop transplant protocols that reduce or even eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications, as these make organ recipients more likely to develop other medical problems.'}],\n",

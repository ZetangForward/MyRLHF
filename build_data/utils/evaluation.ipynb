Luckily, the\\nbalcony was very dark. Le Moyne, and he knows who you are very\\nwell, indeed.\" Didn\\'t the Street beat the Linburgs\\nthe other day? And I believe the Rosenfelds are in receipt of sixty-five\\ncents a day and considerable peace and quiet through you, Mr. You\\'re the most popular man on the Street.\" Wilson is here to see\\nyour mother--\"\\n\\n\"Going,\" said Sidney. Wilson is a very great person, K., so be\\npolite to him.\" Max had roused at the sound of Le Moyne\\'s voice, not to suspicion,\\nof course, but to memory. Without any apparent reason, he was back in\\nBerlin, tramping the country roads, and beside him--\\n\\n\"Wonderful night!\" \"The mind\\'s a curious thing, isn\\'t it. In the\\ninstant since Miss Page went through that window I\\'ve been to Berlin and\\nback! K. struck a match with his steady hands. Now that the thing had come, he\\nwas glad to face it. In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the\\nnight. \"Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin.\" Blackness had descended on them again, except\\nfor the dull glow of K. The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the\\ncurtains.\" I\\'ll talk to you, if you\\'ll\\nsit still. \"I\\'ve been here--in the city, I mean--for a year. Don\\'t\\nforget it--Le Moyne. I\\'ve got a position in the gas office, clerical. I have reason to think I\\'m going to be moved\\nup. That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two.\" Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words. Only a part of what K.\\nsaid got to him. For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this\\nman across from him--it was not believable! \"It\\'s not hard work, and it\\'s safe. If I make a mistake there\\'s no life\\nhanging on it. Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago. It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket. Wilson\\'s voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was\\nprofoundly moved. When a year\\nwent by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on\\nit--we gave up. I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college. I\\nwent down for the--for the services.\" \"Let it stay,\" said K. quietly. \"I\\'m dead as far as the college goes,\\nanyhow. And, for Heaven\\'s sake,\\ndon\\'t be sorry for me. I\\'m more contented than I\\'ve been for a long\\ntime.\" The wonder in Wilson\\'s voice was giving way to irritation. Why, good Heavens, man, I did your\\noperation to-day, and I\\'ve been blowing about it ever since.\" When that\\nhappened I gave up. All a man in our profession has is a certain method,\\nknowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself. I lost my\\nself-confidence; that\\'s all. For about a year I was\\ndamned sorry for myself. \"If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I\\'ve just told you I\\ndid your operation to-day. There was just a chance for the man, and I\\ntook my courage in my hands and tried it. K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail. Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown\\nof stars. Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men\\nhe had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his\\nlanguage, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze\\ntablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and\\ngrave eyes. He heard--\\n\\nHe heard the soft rustle of Sidney\\'s dress as she came into the little\\nroom behind them. CHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nA few days after Wilson\\'s recognition of K., two most exciting things\\nhappened to Sidney. One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor\\nat her wedding. She was accepted, and\\ngiven her cap. Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house\\nhad no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le\\nMoyne:\\n\\nDEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute. I am as\\nconscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to\\ndeserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall. I am writing\\nthis on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It. I am\\nafraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means. Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward. I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and\\nturn all around and let them see it, without saying a word. You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible\\nthis happiness of mine to-night. I am promising myself to be very good,\\nand not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now. Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor\\nJoe has both forgiven and forgotten. K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and\\ncarried it upstairs to read. Whatever faint hope he might have had that\\nher youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over. With the\\nletter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty\\nyears. But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her. He\\nsurmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she\\nmight come to care for him, his very presence in the little house\\nmilitated against him. There was none of the illusion of separation;\\nhe was always there, like Katie. When she opened the door, she called\\n\"Mother\" from the hall. If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much\\nthe same voice. He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson\\'s\\nrecognition and protest. But enduring philosophy comes only with time;\\nand he was young. Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a\\npassion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength. And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney\\'s letter. Its very\\nfrankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;\\nbut he craved so much more. He threw himself face down on the bed, with\\nthe paper crushed in his hand. Sidney\\'s letter was not the only one he received that day. When, in\\nresponse to Katie\\'s summons, he rose heavily and prepared for dinner, he\\nfound an unopened envelope on the table. It was from Max Wilson:--\\n\\nDEAR LE MOYNE,--I have been going around in a sort of haze all day. The\\nfact that I only heard your voice and scarcely saw you last night has\\nmade the whole thing even more unreal. I have a feeling of delicacy about trying to see you again so soon. I\\'m\\nbound to respect your seclusion. But there are some things that have got\\nto be discussed. You said last night that things were \"different\" with you. Do you know any man in our\\nprofession who has not? And, for fear you think I do not know what I am\\ntalking about, the thing was threshed out at the State Society when the\\nquestion of the tablet came up. Old Barnes got up and said: \"Gentlemen,\\nall of us live more or less in glass houses. Let him who is without\\nguilt among us throw the first stone!\" I took my little car and drove around the\\ncountry roads, and the farther I went the more outrageous your position\\nbecame. I\\'m not going to write any rot about the world needing men like\\nyou, although it\\'s true enough. You working in\\na gas office, while old O\\'Hara bungles and hacks, and I struggle along\\non what I learned from you! It takes courage to step down from the pinnacle you stood on. So it\\'s\\nnot cowardice that has set you down here. The first, and best, is for you to go back. No one has taken your place, because no one could do the work. But if\\nthat\\'s out of the question,--and only you know that, for only you know\\nthe facts,--the next best thing is this, and in all humility I make the\\nsuggestion. Take the State exams under your present name, and when you\\'ve got your\\ncertificate, come in with me. I\\'ll be getting a\\ndamn sight more than I give. It is a curious fact that a man who is absolutely untrustworthy about\\nwomen is often the soul of honor to other men. The younger Wilson,\\ntaking his pleasures lightly and not too discriminatingly, was making an\\noffer that meant his ultimate eclipse, and doing it cheerfully, with his\\neyes open. It was like Max to make such an offer, like him to make it\\nas if he were asking a favor and not conferring one. But the offer left\\nhim untempted. He had weighed himself in the balance, and found himself\\nwanting. No tablet on the college wall could change that. And when,\\nlate that night, Wilson found him on the balcony and added appeal to\\nargument, the situation remained unchanged. He realized its hopelessness\\nwhen K. lapsed into whimsical humor. \"I\\'m not absolutely useless where I am, you know, Max,\" he said. \"I\\'ve\\nraised three tomato plants and a family of kittens this summer, helped\\nto plan a trousseau, assisted in selecting wall-paper for the room just\\ninside,--did you notice it?--and developed a boy pitcher with a ball\\nthat twists around the bat like a Colles fracture around a splint!\" \"If you\\'re going to be humorous--\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow,\" said K. quietly, \"if I had no sense of humor, I should\\ngo upstairs to-night, turn on the gas, and make a stertorous entrance\\ninto eternity. By the way, that\\'s something I forgot!\" Among my other activities, I wired the parlor for\\nelectric light. The bride-to-be expects some electroliers as wedding\\ngifts, and--\"\\n\\nWilson rose and flung his cigarette into the grass. K. rose with him, and all the suppressed feeling of the interview was\\ncrowded into his last few words. \"I\\'m not as ungrateful as you think, Max,\" he said. \"I--you\\'ve helped\\na lot. I\\'m as well off as I deserve to be, and\\nbetter. Wilson\\'s unexpected magnanimity put K. in a curious position--left him,\\nas it were, with a divided allegiance. Sidney\\'s frank infatuation for\\nthe young surgeon was growing. And where before\\nhe might have felt justified in going to the length of warning her, now\\nhis hands were tied. More than once he had\\ntaken Sidney back to the hospital in his car. Le Moyne, handicapped at\\nevery turn, found himself facing two alternatives, one but little better\\nthan the other. The affair might run a legitimate course, ending in\\nmarriage--a year of happiness for her, and then what marriage with\\nMax, as he knew him, would inevitably mean: wanderings away, remorseful\\nreturns to her, infidelities, misery. Or, it might be less serious but\\nalmost equally unhappy for her. Max might throw caution to the winds,\\npursue her for a time,--K. had seen him do this,--and then, growing\\ntired, change to some new attraction. In either case, he could only wait\\nand watch, eating his heart out during the long evenings when Anna read\\nher \"Daily Thoughts\" upstairs and he sat alone with his pipe on the\\nbalcony. Sidney went on night duty shortly after her acceptance. All of her\\norderly young life had been divided into two parts: day, when one\\nplayed or worked, and night, when one slept. Now she was compelled to\\na readjustment: one worked in the night and slept in the day. At the end of her first night report Sidney\\nadded what she could remember of a little verse of Stevenson\\'s. She\\nadded it to the end of her general report, which was to the effect that\\neverything had been quiet during the night except the neighborhood. \"And does it not seem hard to you,\\n      When all the sky is clear and blue,\\n      And I should like so much to play,\\n      To have to go to bed by day?\" The day assistant happened on the report, and was quite scandalized. \"If the night nurses are to spend their time making up poetry,\" she\\nsaid crossly, \"we\\'d better change this hospital into a young ladies\\'\\nseminary. If she wants to complain about the noise in the street, she\\nshould do so in proper form.\" \"I don\\'t think she made it up,\" said the Head, trying not to smile. \"I\\'ve heard something like it somewhere, and, what with the heat and the\\nnoise of traffic, I don\\'t see how any of them get any sleep.\" But, because discipline must be observed, she wrote on the slip the\\nassistant carried around: \"Please submit night reports in prose.\" She tumbled into her low bed at nine o\\'clock\\nin the morning, those days, with her splendid hair neatly braided down\\nher back and her prayers said, and immediately her active young mind\\nfilled with images--Christine\\'s wedding, Dr. Max passing the door of her\\nold ward and she not there, Joe--even Tillie, whose story was now the\\nsensation of the Street. A few months before she would not have cared\\nto think of Tillie. She would have retired her into the land of\\nthings-one-must-forget. But the Street\\'s conventions were not holding\\nSidney\\'s thoughts now. She puzzled over Tillie a great deal, and over\\nGrace and her kind. On her first night on duty, a girl had been brought in from the Avenue. She had taken a poison--nobody knew just what. When the internes had\\ntried to find out, she had only said: \"What\\'s the use?\" those mornings when she could not get\\nto sleep. People were kind--men were kind, really,--and yet, for some\\nreason or other, those things had to be. After a time Sidney would doze fitfully. But by three o\\'clock she was\\nalways up and dressing. Lack of\\nsleep wrote hollows around her eyes and killed some of her bright color. Between three and four o\\'clock in the morning she was overwhelmed on\\nduty by a perfect madness of sleep. There was a penalty for sleeping on\\nduty. The old night watchman had a way of slipping up on one nodding. The night nurses wished they might fasten a bell on him! Luckily, at four came early-morning temperatures; that roused her. And\\nafter that came the clatter of early milk-wagons and the rose hues of\\ndawn over the roofs. Twice in the night, once at supper and again toward\\ndawn, she drank strong black coffee. But after a week or two her nerves\\nwere stretched taut as a string. Her station was in a small room close to her three wards. But she sat\\nvery little, as a matter of fact. Her responsibility was heavy on her;\\nshe made frequent rounds. The late summer nights were fitful, feverish;\\nthe darkened wards stretched away like caverns from the dim light near\\nthe door. And from out of these caverns came petulant voices, uneasy\\nmovements, the banging of a cup on a bedside, which was the signal of\\nthirst. To them, perhaps just\\na little weary with time and much service, the banging cup meant not so\\nmuch thirst as annoyance. \"Don\\'t jump like that, child; they\\'re not parched, you know.\" \"But if you have a fever and are thirsty--\"\\n\\n\"Thirsty nothing! \"Then,\" Sidney would say, rising resolutely, \"they are going to see me.\" Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself. They\\nliked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet\\nand tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service\\nhad drained them dry. They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking\\nmachines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that\\ntheir service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart. To them,\\npain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written\\non the tablets of her soul. Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night\\nservice, as it was Sidney\\'s first. She had\\ncharge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the\\nward into which all emergency cases were taken. It was a difficult\\nservice, perhaps the most difficult in the house. Scarcely a night went\\nby without its patrol or ambulance case. Ordinarily, the emergency ward\\nhad its own night nurse. Belated\\nvacations and illness had depleted the training-school. Carlotta, given\\ndouble duty, merely shrugged her shoulders. \"I\\'ve always had things pretty hard here,\" she commented briefly. \"When I go out, I\\'ll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital\\nsinglehanded, or I\\'ll be carried out feet first.\" She knew her better than she knew\\nthe other nurses. Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding\\nher at a loss. Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a\\nsoft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,\\ngoing out, would see Sidney\\'s flushed face and slightly crooked cap\\nbending over the stair-rail. \"I\\'m dreadfully sorry to bother you,\" she would say, \"but So-and-So\\nwon\\'t have a fever bath\"; or, \"I\\'ve a woman here who refuses her\\nmedicine.\" Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers. Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never\\noccurred to her to refuse her assistance. Perhaps the angels who keep\\nthe great record will put that to her credit. Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty. It was\\nthe most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it\\nwas quiet enough. So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.\\'s little watch\\nin hand, was not sure exactly when it happened. The light was very dim\\nbehind the little screen. One moment the sheet was quivering slightly\\nunder the struggle for breath, the next it was still. That life, so potential, so tremendous a\\nthing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate\\nalways in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand\\nit. Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying. She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to\\nreport--basins left about, errors on her records. She rinsed her\\nthermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending\\nhim word that Mary McGuire\\'s temperature was a hundred and ten degrees. She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go\\nairily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened! Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and\\nbringing the runaway back single-handed. For Christine\\'s wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed\\na wedding garment. In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the\\ndetails. \"An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!\" Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz\\nhouse. \"And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!\" Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and\\nrecreation. \"Why do they ask \\'em if they don\\'t trust \\'em?\" But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate. It recalled to\\nhim many things that were better forgotten. He rose and scowled at his\\nwife. \"You tell Johnny something for me,\" he snarled. \"You tell him when he\\nsees his father walking down street, and he sittin\\' up there alone on\\nthat automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him. Me\\nwalking, while my son swells around in a car! \"You let me hear of him road-housin\\', and\\nI\\'ll kill him!\" The wedding was to be at five o\\'clock. This, in itself, defied all\\ntraditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early\\nmorning at the Catholic church or at eight o\\'clock in the evening at\\nthe Presbyterian. There was something reckless about five o\\'clock. It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a\\nmarriage was not quite legal. The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one. Ed\\nresurrected an old black frock-coat and had a \"V\" of black cambric set\\nin the vest. Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a\\nnew Panama to wear with it. The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at\\nMcKees\\', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of\\nthe excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered\\nhimself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the\\nchurch. The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers. When the newspapers came\\nout with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that\\nSidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the\\nhospital training-school. A probationer was authorized to find out\\nparticulars. It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had\\nnot been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory\\nAnnex, drying her hair. \"I--I just wonder,\" she said, \"if you would let some of the girls come\\nin to see you when you\\'re dressed?\" \"It\\'s awfully thrilling, isn\\'t it? \"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?\" They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not\\nthere. The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set\\nto work with a fan at Sidney\\'s hair. \"He\\'s awfully good-looking, isn\\'t he?\" She was not ignorant of the methods of the school. If\\nthis girl was pumping her--\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have to think that over,\" she said, with a glint of mischief in\\nher eyes. \"When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether\\nhe\\'s good-looking or not.\" \"I suppose,\" said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney\\'s\\nhair through her fingers, \"that when you are at home you see him often.\" Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by\\nthe shoulders, faced her toward the door. \"You go back to the girls,\" she said, \"and tell them to come in and see\\nme when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don\\'t know whether I am to\\nwalk down the aisle with Dr. She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind\\nher. That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison. She, too, had not slept during the day. When the probationer who\\nhad brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white\\nnight-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like\\nceiling of her little room. She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the\\nchurch; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay\\nthere, she knew that Max Wilson\\'s eyes would be, not on the bride, but\\non the girl who stood beside her. The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding\\nif she wanted to. She\\'d happened on a bit of information--many a wedding\\nhad been stopped for less. It rather obsessed her to think of stopping\\nthe wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle\\ntogether. There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish\\nactivities of the previous month. In the Lorenz\\nkitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs. In the attic, in the center of a\\nsheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her\\nbenefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride. All the second story\\nhad been prepared for guests and presents. Florists were still busy in the room below. Bridesmaids were clustered\\non the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and\\ncalling reports to Christine through the closed door:--\\n\\n\"Another wooden box, Christine. What will you\\never do with them all?\" Here\\'s another of the neighbors who wants to see how you\\nlook. Do say you can\\'t have any visitors now.\" Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet. The bridesmaids had been\\nsternly forbidden to come into her room. \"I haven\\'t had a chance to think for a month,\" she said. \"And I\\'ve got\\nsome things I\\'ve got to think out.\" But, when Sidney came, she sent for her. Sidney found her sitting on a\\nstiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small\\nstand. And, after Sidney had kissed her:--\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a good mind not to do it.\" \"You\\'re tired and nervous, that\\'s all.\" But that isn\\'t what\\'s wrong with me. Throw that veil\\nsome place and sit down.\" Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch. Sidney thought\\nbrides should be rather pale. But under her eyes were lines that Sidney\\nhad never seen there before. \"I\\'m not going to be foolish, Sidney. I\\'ll go through with it, of\\ncourse. It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.\" \"Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night. Somebody called father up to-day and\\nsaid that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano. He hasn\\'t\\nbeen here to-day.\" And as for the other--perhaps it wasn\\'t Palmer who did\\nit.\" Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but\\nthree months had made a change in Sidney. The complacent sophistries\\nof her girlhood no longer answered for truth. She put her arms around\\nChristine\\'s shoulders. \"A man who drinks is a broken reed,\" said Christine. \"That\\'s what I\\'m\\ngoing to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed. She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,\\nbolted the door. Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held\\nto Sidney a letter. It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--\\n\\nAsk your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue. Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney. Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was. The\\npaper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off. The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face\\nand cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her! One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside. \"Another electric lamp,\" she called excitedly through the door. \"You see,\" Christine said drearily. \"I have received another electric\\nlamp, and Palmer is downstairs! I\\'ve got to go through with it, I\\nsuppose. The only difference between me and other brides is that I know\\nwhat I\\'m getting. \"It\\'s too late to do anything else. I am not going to give this\\nneighborhood anything to talk about.\" She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head. Sidney stood\\nwith the letter in her hands.\\'s answers to her hot question\\nhad been this:--\\n\\n\"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead. What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what\\nshe is going to be.\" \"Even granting this to be true,\" she said to Christine slowly,--\"and it\\nmay only be malicious after all, Christine,--it\\'s surely over and done\\nwith. It\\'s not Palmer\\'s past that concerns you now; it\\'s his future with\\nyou, isn\\'t it?\" A band of duchesse lace rose\\nlike a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of\\nher train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle. She arranged the coronet\\ncarefully with small pearl-topped pins. Then she rose and put her hands\\non Sidney\\'s shoulders. \"The simple truth is,\" she said quietly, \"that I might hold Palmer if\\nI cared--terribly. It\\'s my pride\\nthat\\'s hurt, nothing else.\" And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding. Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held. Already, in\\nher new philosophy, she had learned many strange things. One of them was\\nthis: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the\\ncode of the underworld was \"death to the squealer\"; that one played the\\ngame, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine. Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course. Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set\\nfire to it with a match. Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes. The alley, however, was\\nrather confused by certain things. For instance, it regarded the awning\\nas essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck\\nin under the side when no one was looking. Rosenfeld absolutely\\nrefused to take the usher\\'s arm which was offered her, and said she\\nguessed she was able to walk up alone. Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete\\nchauffeur\\'s outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was\\nhis State license pinned over his heart. The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to\\nsupper. Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case\\nonly ice cream and cake were served at the house? Or was it just as well\\nto trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit\\ndown to a cold snack when they got home? To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the\\nwedding was Sidney--Sidney only. He watched her first steps down the\\naisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched\\nthe swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him\\nand went forward past the long rows of craning necks. Afterward he could\\nnot remember the wedding party at all. The service for him was Sidney,\\nrather awed and very serious, beside the altar. It was Sidney who came\\ndown the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney\\nwith Max beside her! On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her\\nnew career. They were more than\\nthat--they were triumphant. Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes\\nover the church, filled with potential brides. To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace\\nand chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph. But to\\nAnna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish\\nlips, was coming her hour. Sitting back in the pew, with her hands\\nfolded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight\\nyoung daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes. As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been\\nstanding at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out. He\\nstumbled, rather, as if he could not see. CHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nThe supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper\\nCarlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together. Carlotta had\\nselected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of\\nthe city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson\\nhad gone out to see her. For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice. She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he\\nwould pay as little as possible. But she knew, too, that, let him want a\\nthing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage. The very ardor in her face was in her favor. She would put the thing\\nthrough, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening\\nprayers, a thing or two. During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate\\nthan the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves\\nrolled up to show her satiny arms. There were no other boarders at the\\nlittle farmhouse. She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square\\nyard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully\\nposed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road. She read\\nBrowning, Emerson, Swinburne. Once he found her with a book that she\\nhastily concealed. He insisted on seeing it, and secured it. Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her\\neyes. His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as\\nshe had intended. \"I feel such an idiot when I am with you,\" she said. \"I wanted to know a\\nlittle more about the things you do.\" That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis. Thereafter\\nhe occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment. His work, a sealed book to his women before,\\nlay open to her. Now and then their professional discussions ended in something\\ndifferent. I can talk\\nshop with you without either shocking or nauseating you. You are the\\nmost intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest.\" He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible\\npurpose of admiring the view. \"As long as you talk shop,\" she said, \"I feel that there is nothing\\nwrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--\"\\n\\n\"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?\" He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her. \"The loveliest mouth in the world!\" She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done. Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride. No, she was not angry, she said. It was only that he had set her\\nthinking. When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and\\ngood-bye. After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it. \"Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the\\nmost dangerous of toys.\" A spice of danger had entered into their\\nrelationship. He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison\\nhad gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back. Every man likes to think that\\nhe is a bit of a devil. Max settled his tie, and, leaving his\\ncar outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the\\ndirection Carlotta had taken. He found her, face down, under a tree,\\nlooking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental\\nstruggle. She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a\\nfoot or two, with her hands out before her. I--I have got to\\nhave a little time alone. He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was\\nquite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree\\nand lighted a cigarette before he answered. \"I was afraid of this,\" he said, playing up. I am not really a villain, Carlotta.\" It was the first time he had used her name. \"Sit down and let us talk things over.\" She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing\\nto him with the somber eyes that were her great asset. \"You can afford to be very calm,\" she said, \"because this is only play\\nto you; I know it. I\\'m a good listener and\\nnot--unattractive. But what is play for you is not necessarily play for\\nme. For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity. If she cried--he was at\\nthe mercy of any woman who cried. This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr. She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her\\nin his arms. You make me feel like\\na scoundrel, and I\\'ve only been taking a little bit of happiness. Max, and kissed her again on the lips. The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself. She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value. But\\nshe had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor\\nwhich in every relationship between man and woman determines the\\nequation,--the woman. Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element. She\\nwho, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and\\nthe things thereof, found that it would not be put aside. By the end of\\nher short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger\\nWilson. They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,\\nperhaps. The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they\\nlost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man. She was shrewd\\nenough to realize her own situation. She\\ncared, and he did not. It was all a game now, not hers. All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so. As well as\\nshe knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she\\nrealized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the\\nreal thing for Sidney Page. Suspicion became certainty after a talk\\nthey had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after\\nChristine\\'s wedding. \"How was the wedding--tiresome?\" There\\'s always something thrilling to me in a man tying\\nhimself up for life to one woman. \"That\\'s not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?\" To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,\\nand electing to spend the rest of one\\'s days with her! Although--\"\\n\\nHis eyes looked past Carlotta into distance. \"Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids,\" he said irrelevantly. \"She was\\nlovelier than the bride.\" \"Pretty, but stupid,\" said Carlotta. I\\'ve really tried to\\nteach her things, but--you know--\" She shrugged her shoulders. If there was a twinkle in his eye, he\\nveiled it discreetly. But, once again in the machine, he bent over and\\nput his cheek against hers. You\\'re jealous,\" he said exultantly. Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very\\nclose to his heart those autumn days. Sidney came off night duty the middle of November. The night duty had\\nbeen a time of comparative peace to Carlotta. Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car. Sidney\\'s half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on\\nCarlotta\\'s part. On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she\\ncould not contain herself. She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and\\ntook the trolley to a point near the end of the Street. After twilight\\nfell, she slowly walked the length of the Street. Christine and Palmer\\nhad not returned from their wedding journey. The November evening was\\nnot cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr. K. was\\nthere, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying\\nlittle, his steady eyes on Sidney\\'s profile. She went on down the Street in a frenzy\\nof jealous anger. After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta\\'s mind: one was to get\\nSidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her. In\\nher heart she knew that on the first depended the second. A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different\\nresult. But standing on the wooden\\ndoorstep of the little house was Le Moyne. The ailanthus trees were\\nbare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky. The\\nstreet-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now\\nshone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne\\'s tall\\nfigure and set face. She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew. It was the first time\\nshe had known that K. lived in the Page house. It gave her a sense of\\nuncertainty and deadly fear. She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the\\nfollowing day. They met in the locker-room in the basement where the\\nstreet clothing for the ward patients was kept. Here, rolled in bundles\\nand ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which\\nthe patients had met accident or illness. Rags and tidiness, filth and\\ncleanliness, lay almost touching. Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were\\nunloading gleaming cans of milk. Floods of sunlight came down the\\ncellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver. Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order. Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation\\nof her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully. \"Grace Irving is going out to-day. When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not\\nlive, it\\'s rather a triumph, isn\\'t it?\" Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her\\nhand. \"She can\\'t go out in those; I shall have to lend her something.\" A\\nlittle of the light died out of her face. \"She\\'s had a hard fight, and\\nshe has won,\" she said. \"But when I think of what she\\'s probably going\\nback to--\"\\n\\nCarlotta shrugged her shoulders. \"It\\'s all in the day\\'s work,\" she observed indifferently. \"You can take\\nthem up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or\\nput them in the laundry ironing. She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully. \"Well, what do you know about this? Here\\'s a woman who came in in a\\nnightgown and pair of slippers. And now she wants to go out in half an\\nhour!\" She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance\\nat Sidney. \"I happened to be on your street the other night,\" she said. \"You live\\nacross the street from Wilsons\\', don\\'t you?\" \"I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house. Your--your brother\\nwas standing on the steps.\" It isn\\'t really\\nright to call him a roomer; he\\'s one of the family now.\"\\'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney. The two girls\\nwent toward the elevator together. With a very little encouragement,\\nSidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison\\'s friendly tone,\\nglad that things were all right between them again. At her floor, she\\nput a timid hand on the girl\\'s arm. \"I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you,\" she said. \"I\\'m so\\nglad it isn\\'t so.\" Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his\\npromotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two\\ndollars a week he was able to do several things. Rosenfeld now\\nwashed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie\\nmight have more time to look after Anna. He had increased also the\\namount of money that he periodically sent East. The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense\\nof failure was Max Wilson\\'s attitude. It was not unfriendly; it was,\\nindeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential. But he clearly\\nconsidered Le Moyne\\'s position absurd. There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was\\nbeginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of\\nfriction. Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne. There were long\\nconsultations in that small upper room. Perhaps more than one man or\\nwoman who did not know of K.\\'s existence owed his life to him that fall. Cases began to come in to him\\nfrom the surrounding towns. To his own daring was added a new and\\nremarkable technique. But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not\\ncontent, was once again in touch with the work he loved. There were\\ntimes when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next\\nday\\'s work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the\\nhills, fighting his battle. The longing was on him to be in the thick\\nof things again. The thought of the gas office and its deadly round\\nsickened him. It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie. It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to\\nrain as it fell. The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside\\npaths thick with sodden leaves. The dreariness of the countryside that\\nSaturday afternoon suited his mood. He had ridden to the end of the\\nstreet-car line, and started his walk from there. As was his custom, he\\nwore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat. Somewhere along\\nthe road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for\\nhuman society, it trotted companionably at his heels. Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and\\nstopped in for a glass of Scotch. The dog\\nwent in with him, and stood looking up into his face. It was as if he\\nsubmitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road\\nahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields. The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills. Through the mist\\nof the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him. The door\\nwas ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet. To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,\\nand in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers. To the\\nleft, the typical parlor of such places. It might have been the parlor\\nof the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all. Over\\neverything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish. The house\\nwas aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the\\ndoors gleamed. called K.\\n\\nThere were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,\\nthe rustle of a woman\\'s dress coming down the stairs. K., standing\\nuncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,\\nstripped off his sweater. he said to the unseen female on the\\nstaircase. She put a hand against the\\ndoorframe to steady herself. Tillie surely, but a new Tillie! With her\\nhair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the\\nthroat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,\\ninfinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her. But she did not\\nsmile at him. There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog\\'s\\nexpression, submissive, but questioning. \"Well, you\\'ve found me, Mr. And, when he held out his hand,\\nsmiling: \"I just had to do it, Mr. You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie.\" Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?\" The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie. The Street did\\nnot approve of \"something else.\" \"Scotch-and-soda,\" said Le Moyne. \"And shall I buy a ticket for you to\\npunch?\" He was sorry he had made the blunder. Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject. It was for this that she had exchanged\\nthe virginal integrity of her life at Mrs. McKee\\'s--for this wind-swept\\nlittle house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely. There were two crayon\\nenlargements over the mantel. The\\nother was the paper-doll wife. K. wondered what curious instinct of\\nself-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed. Back of its position of honor he saw the girl\\'s realization of her own\\nsituation. On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was\\nanother vase of dried flowers. Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass. K. would\\nhave preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good. \"You gave me a turn at first,\" said Tillie. \"But I am right glad to see\\nyou, Mr. Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much. Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the\\ncommon ground of food. They no longer had that, and between them both\\nlay like a barrier their last conversation. More attractive it certainly was,\\nbut happy? There was a wistfulness about Tillie\\'s mouth that set him\\nwondering. \"He\\'s about the best man on earth. He\\'s never said a cross word to\\nme--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.\" \"I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding\\nwhen I heard people around the place. It used to seem to me that what\\nI\\'d done was written on my face. Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel. \"Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I\\'ve a chicken ready or\\nsome fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look\\nrested. He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the\\ndishes. \"I wouldn\\'t go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr. This place is his, and he\\'d like a boy to come into it\\nwhen he\\'s gone. if I did have one; what would it be?\"\\'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath. \"And she--there isn\\'t any prospect of her--?\" There was no solution to Tillie\\'s problem. Le Moyne, standing on the\\nhearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must\\nwork out her own salvation. They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon. Tillie was\\nhungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine\\'s wedding, of\\nHarriet, of Sidney in her hospital. And when he had told her all, she\\nsat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers. Then:--\\n\\n\"Take the four of us,\" she said suddenly,--\"Christine Lorenz and Sidney\\nPage and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to\\ngo wrong like this? I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would\\nhave thought it would be the Lorenz girl. They\\'d have picked Harriet\\nKennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have\\nbeen Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile. She looked up at K. shrewdly. They didn\\'t know me, and I\\nheard them talking. They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr. As she\\nstood before him she looked up into his face. \"If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr. Le Moyne, you won\\'t let\\nhim get her.\" \"I am afraid that\\'s not up to me, is it? What would I do with a wife,\\nTillie?\" I guess, in the\\nlong run, that would count more than money.\" That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie. He\\npondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against\\nthe wind. Wagon-tracks along the road were\\nfilled with water and had begun to freeze. The rain had turned to a\\ndriving sleet that cut his face. Halfway to the trolley line, the dog\\nturned off into a by-road. The dog stared after\\nhim, one foot raised. Once again his eyes were like Tillie\\'s, as she had\\nwaved good-bye from the porch. His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,\\nswinging pace, and fought his battle. Was Tillie right, after all, and\\nhad he been wrong? Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney\\'s\\nunhappiness? Why not accept Wilson\\'s offer and start over again? Then\\nif things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon. He\\nput it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did\\nwould make no change in Sidney\\'s ultimate decision. If she cared enough\\nfor Wilson, she would marry him. CHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nPalmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.\\ndiscovered Tillie. Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on\\ndinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine\\nunpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment. She\\nwas brighter than she had been for days, more interested. The wonders of\\nthe trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for\\nSidney, who could have none of these things. In a pathetic sort of way,\\nshe mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter. And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong. Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve. Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to\\nsome speech of Christine\\'s that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,\\nshe gave her a gentle admonishing. \"Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear,\" she said. \"After we\\nhave lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live\\nfor some one else.\" Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging. But why should the woman do all the adjusting?\" \"Men are more set,\" said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything\\nin her life. \"It is harder for them to give in. And, of course, Palmer\\nis older, and his habits--\"\\n\\n\"The less said about Palmer\\'s habits the better,\" flashed Christine. \"I\\nappear to have married a bunch of habits.\" She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while\\nAnna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her. Six weeks of Palmer\\'s society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine\\nto distraction. She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that\\nseemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;\\nPalmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his\\ncoffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper. And there was a darker side to the picture than that. There was a vision\\nof Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy\\nsleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink. She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he\\nlived. The letter she had received on\\nher wedding day was burned into her brain. There would be that in the\\nfuture too, probably. She was making a brave clutch\\nat happiness. But that afternoon of the first day at home she was\\nterrified. She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire. But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself. She\\nhad determined to meet Palmer with a smile. Tears brought nothing;\\nshe had learned that already. \"Daughters of joy,\" they called girls like the one on the Avenue. She waited while, with his back to her, he\\nshook himself like a great dog. He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting. \"It\\'s good to be home and to see you again. Won\\'t you come in to my\\nfire?\" \"All the more reason why you should come,\" she cried gayly, and held the\\ndoor wide. The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with\\nsilver vases full of flowers. K. stepped inside and took a critical\\nsurvey of the room. \"Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I\\nwith the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and\\nyour pretty self.\" Christine saw his approval, and was\\nhappier than she had been for weeks. She put on the thousand little airs\\nand graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at\\nhim with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on\\nPalmer. She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair\\nfor him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands. \"And see, here\\'s a footstool.\" \"I am ridiculously fond of being babied,\" said K., and quite basked in\\nhis new atmosphere of well-being. This was better than his empty room\\nupstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts. \"Do\\ntell me all the scandal of the Street.\" \"There has been no scandal since you went away,\" said K. And, because\\neach was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this\\nbit of unconscious humor. \"Seriously,\" said Le Moyne, \"we have been very quiet. I have had my\\nsalary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week. Just when I had all my ideas fixed for\\nfifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them. \"It is very disagreeable when one\\'s income becomes a burden,\" said\\nChristine gravely. She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a\\nsolidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with\\nheaviness. She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide\\nin. She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine\\nprofile with its strong chin. She left off her little affectations,--a\\ntribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching\\nthe fire. When K. chose, he could talk well. The Howes had been to Bermuda on\\ntheir wedding trip. He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground. As for K., he frankly enjoyed\\nthe little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair. \"You\\'ve been very nice to ask me in, Mrs. \"I hope you\\nwill allow me to come again. But, of course, you are going to be very\\ngay.\" It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again. She did not\\nwant him to go away. The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of\\nsecurity. She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at\\nlast he made a move toward the door. Howe I am sorry he missed our little party,\" said Le Moyne. As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine\\'s\\neyes. Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless. One\\nmight still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice. When\\nPalmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced. The day\\'s exertion had been bad for Anna. Le Moyne found her on the\\ncouch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of\\napprehension. She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of\\naromatic ammonia beside her. \"Just--short of breath,\" she panted. Sidney--is\\ncoming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--\"\\n\\nThat was as far as she got. K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,\\nstringy, irregular. He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he\\nhurried into his room for amyl-nitrate. When he came back she was almost\\nunconscious. He broke the capsule\\nin a towel, and held it over her face. After a time the spasm relaxed,\\nbut her condition remained alarming. Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her\\nsister\\'s hand. Only once in the next hour or so did she speak. Harriet was too wretched to\\nnotice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna. \"I\\'ve been a very hard sister to her,\" she said. \"If you can pull her\\nthrough, I\\'ll try to make up for it.\" Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless. They had\\nsent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message\\nwas slow in getting off. Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room. \"Well, this is sad, Harriet,\" said Dr. \"Why in the name of Heaven,\\nwhen I wasn\\'t around, didn\\'t you get another doctor. If she had had some\\namyl-nitrate--\"\\n\\n\"I gave her some nitrate of amyl,\" said K. quietly. \"There was really no\\ntime to send for anybody. She almost went under at half-past five.\" Max had kept his word, and even Dr. He\\ngave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what\\nhe had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work. Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in\\nthe sick-room was at an end. She moved Christine from the stairs,\\nwhere Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to\\nwarming her mother\\'s bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought\\norder and quiet. And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her\\nposition beside her mother. This was no time for weeping; that would\\ncome later. Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her. \"I think you have known this for a long time,\" she said. And, when he\\ndid not answer: \"Why did you let me stay away from her? It would have\\nbeen such a little time!\" \"We were trying to do our best for both of you,\" he replied. It came as a cry from the depths of the\\ngirl\\'s new experience. \"She has had so little of life,\" she said, over and over. \"After all, Sidney,\" he said, \"the Street IS life: the world is only\\nmany streets. She had love and content, and she\\nhad you.\" Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney\\nand the two men knew when she went away. John travelled to the hallway. During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of\\nsmall unkindnesses. The thorn of Anna\\'s inefficiency had always rankled\\nin her flesh. She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted. Once he thought she was fainting, and\\nwent to her. Do you think you could get them all out of the room and\\nlet me have her alone for just a few minutes?\" He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door. And, as he\\nstood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street. Here in this very house were death and\\nseparation; Harriet\\'s starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a\\nlong and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor. When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother\\'s bed. Mary journeyed to the bathroom. He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder\\nlike a tired child. \"Take me away, K.,\" she said pitifully. And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room. Outside of her small immediate circle Anna\\'s death was hardly felt. Harriet carried back to her\\nbusiness a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with\\nthe small irritations of her day. Perhaps Anna\\'s incapacity, which had\\nalways annoyed her, had been physical. She must have had her trouble a\\nlongtime. She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through\\ninefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed\\ntheir mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families. What did\\nthey think about, these women, as they pottered about? Did they resent\\nthe impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference\\nthat would not see how they were failing? Hot tears fell on Harriet\\'s\\nfashion-book as it lay on her knee. Not only for Anna--for Anna\\'s\\nprototypes everywhere. On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of\\nthe disaster. Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down\\nthe next day with a low fever. Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital\\nagain until Christmas. Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and\\ninquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney\\'s reply:--\\n\\n\"Much better. But the days dragged on and she did not get about. Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter\\ngayeties. Palmer\\'s \"crowd\" was a lively one. There were dinners\\nand dances, week-end excursions to country-houses. The Street grew\\naccustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all\\nhours of the night. Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer\\'s car, took to\\nfalling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent\\nto his mother. \"You never know where you are with them guys,\" he said briefly. \"We\\nstart out for half an hour\\'s run in the evening, and get home with the\\nmilk-wagons. And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they\\nwant to drive the machine. If I get a chance, I\\'m going to beat it while\\nthe wind\\'s my way.\" But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld\\'s loyal heart there was no\\nthought of desertion. Palmer had given him a man\\'s job, and he would\\nstick by it, no matter what came. There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother. There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine\\nand her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the\\ndestination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when\\nJohnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver\\'s seat by some drunken youth,\\nwould hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers\\nas he could remember. Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few\\nillusions, was in danger of losing such as he had. One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the\\nclock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night. He sent a note from the office in the morning:\\n\\n\"I hope you are not worried, darling. The car broke down near the\\nCountry Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the\\nnight there. I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse\\nyou. What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?\" She telephoned the Country Club that morning,\\nand found that Palmer had not been there. But, although she knew now\\nthat he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably\\nhe always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew. She\\nshrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his\\nlie. But the second time it happened, she was roused. It was almost Christmas\\nthen, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very\\nwhite, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.\\'s arm, and\\nsitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table. She was begging to be\\nback on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her\\nup soon. At three o\\'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a\\nrapping on her door. She carried a\\ncandle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney\\'s watch on the bedside\\ntable. \"I hoped my clock was wrong,\" she said. \"I am sorry to waken you,\\nSidney, but I don\\'t know what to do.\" Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown. \"When he went out did he say--\"\\n\\n\"He said nothing. Sidney, I am going home in the\\nmorning.\" \"You don\\'t mean that, do you?\" \"Don\\'t I look as if I mean it? How much of this sort of thing is a woman\\nsupposed to endure?\" These things always seem terrible in the\\nmiddle of the night, but by morning--\"\\n\\nChristine whirled on her. You remember the letter I got on my wedding\\nday?\" \"Believe it or not,\" said Christine doggedly, \"that\\'s exactly what has\\nhappened. I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and\\nthe rest I know because I know Palmer. The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to\\nmake a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious. But\\nvice had remained for her a clear abstraction. There were such people,\\nand because one was in the world for service one cared for them. Even\\nthe Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets. But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that\\nbecause of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked. \"It makes me hate all the men in the world. Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!\" Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room. Mere companionship\\nhad soothed her. She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than\\nSidney. \"They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven,\" she said. My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is\\nanother.\" At four o\\'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home. She\\nconfronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak. \"I am sorry to be so late, Chris,\" he said. \"The fact is, I am all in. I\\nwas driving the car out Seven Mile Run. We blew out a tire and the thing\\nturned over.\" Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side. CHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nYoung Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits\\nwith his wedding day. In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much\\nin love with his wife. But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of\\nmarriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face\\nvalue. Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed\\nto be. She knew him now--all his small\\nindolences, his affectations, his weaknesses. Later on, like other\\nwomen since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to\\nbelieve him what he was not. And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer\\nHowe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for\\ncomradeship. Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he\\nwanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he\\nwanted approval. He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without\\nrecriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was\\nthirsty. Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,\\ndeep in his heart Palmer\\'s only longing was for happiness; but this\\nhappiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but\\nenjoyment. No taxi working its head\\noff for us. Just a little run over the country roads, eh?\" It was the afternoon of the day before Christine\\'s night visit to\\nSidney. The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in\\npossession of a holiday. \"We\\'ll go out to the Climbing Rose and have\\nsupper.\" \"That\\'s not true, Grace, and you know it.\" The roads are frozen hard; an hour\\'s run\\ninto the country will bring your color back.\" Go and ride with your wife,\" said the girl,\\nand flung away from him. The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore\\ntraces of her illness. She\\nlooked curiously boyish, almost sexless. Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper\\nincreased. \"You get out of here,\" she said suddenly. \"I didn\\'t ask you to come\\nback. You always knew I would have to marry some day.\" I didn\\'t hear any reports of you hanging\\naround the hospital to learn how I was getting along.\" Besides, one of--\" He hesitated over his wife\\'s name. \"A\\ngirl I know very well was in the training-school. There would have been\\nthe devil to pay if I\\'d as much as called up.\" \"You never told me you were going to get married.\" Cornered, he slipped an arm around her. \"I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick. Anyhow, I--I hated to\\ntell you, honey.\" There was a comfortable feeling of\\ncoming home about going there again. And, now that the worst minute of\\ntheir meeting was over, he was visibly happier. But Grace continued to\\nstand eyeing him somberly. \"I\\'ve got something to tell you,\" she said. \"Don\\'t have a fit, and don\\'t\\nlaugh. If you do, I\\'ll--I\\'ll jump out of the window. I\\'ve got a place in\\na store. She was a nice girl and he was fond of her. And he was not unselfish about it. He did not want her to belong to any one else. \"One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to\\ndo at Lipton and Homburg\\'s. I am going on for the January white sale. If\\nI make good they will keep me.\" He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement\\nwith approval. They would have a holiday\\ntogether, and then they would say good-bye. He was getting off well, all things considered. But that isn\\'t any\\nreason why we shouldn\\'t be friends, is it? I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you\\ndo.\" The mention of Sidney\\'s name brought up in his mind Christine as he had\\nleft her that morning. She used to be a good sport,\\nbut she had never been the same since the day of the wedding. He thought\\nher attitude toward him was one of suspicion. But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence. \"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" he said. \"We won\\'t go to any of the old\\nplaces. I\\'ve found a new roadhouse in the country that\\'s respectable\\nenough to suit anybody. We\\'ll go out to Schwitter\\'s and get some dinner. And on the way out he lived up to the letter of\\ntheir agreement. The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air\\nof virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld\\'s\\ndiscreet back and alert ears. The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it. He treated the\\ngirl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt\\nglowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time. When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a\\nfive-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld\\'s not over-clean hand. \"I don\\'t mind the ears,\" he said. And\\nJohnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise. \"There\\'s just enough of the Jew in me,\" said Johnny, \"to know how to\\ntalk a lot and say nothing, Mr. He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it. \"I\\'ll just give her the \\'once over\\' now and then,\" he said. \"She\\'ll\\nfreeze solid if I let her stand.\" Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house. She had the gift of\\nlooking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill\\nand her motor-coat were chic and becoming. She never overdressed, as\\nChristine was inclined to do. Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him. A heavy German maid\\nwaited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in\\nthe kitchen. Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with\\nvisions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw\\nher through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated. Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling\\ninto the tonneau, covered himself with rugs. In his untutored mind were\\ncertain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one. The five\\ndollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it. At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words. It took the\\nplace of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism. It\\nwas: \"Mind your own business.\" The discovery of Tillie\\'s hiding-place interested but did not thrill\\nhim. If she wanted to do the sort of thing she\\nwas doing, that was her affair. Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer\\nHowe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships. It\\nviewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its\\nhands. True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine\\no\\'clock. Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly\\nstimulated. \"Give her the \\'once over,\\'\" he told Johnny, \"and then go back and crawl\\ninto the rugs again. Their progress was slow and rough over the\\ncountry roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the\\nthrottle. He took chances\\nand got away with them, laughing at the girl\\'s gasps of dismay. \"Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville,\" he said, \"and I\\'ll let her out. The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead. He had been drinking,\\nand the warmth of the liquor was in his voice. She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to\\ngo away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would\\nbe difficult. Instead of laughing when\\nshe drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly. Obstinate lines\\nthat she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his\\nmouth. Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood\\nand let her get out of the car. Now it passed them, and as\\noften they passed it. Palmer\\'s car lost on\\nthe hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a\\ncoating of thin ice. \"I wish you\\'d let them get ahead, Palmer. \"I told you we\\'d travel to-night.\" What the deuce was the matter with\\nwomen, anyhow? Here was Grace as\\nsober as Christine. His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily. On a smooth road\\nperhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the\\nresult. But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the\\nedge of the bank. At the bottom of the declivity it turned over. Howe freed himself and stood\\nerect, with one arm hanging at his side. There was no sound at all from\\nthe boy under the tonneau. Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like\\nfigure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees. When he\\nreached the car, O\\'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground. In the\\nwreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light\\nhe made out Howe, swaying dizzily. The other members of O\\'Hara\\'s party had crawled down the bank by that\\ntime. With the aid of a jack, they got the car up. Johnny Rosenfeld lay\\ndoubled on his face underneath. When he came to and opened his eyes,\\nGrace almost shrieked with relief. \"I\\'m all right,\" said Johnny Rosenfeld. And, when they offered him\\nwhiskey: \"Away with the fire-water. I--I--\" A spasm of\\npain twisted his face. With his arms he lifted\\nhimself to a sitting position, and fell back again. CHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nBy Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but\\nvaliantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service. She had a\\ntalk with K. the night before she left. Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order. K. sat by\\nthe table and watched her as she moved about the room. The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and\\ndown the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch\\nin the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home\\nfor her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to\\nbear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in\\nyears. \"I hope you don\\'t feel as if you must stay on,\" she said anxiously. \"Not\\nthat we don\\'t want you--you know better than that.\" \"There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to,\" he\\nsaid simply. \"I seem to be always relying on somebody\\'s kindness to--to keep things\\ntogether. First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is\\nyou.\" \"Don\\'t you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is\\nI who am undeniably grateful to you? I have lived\\naround--in different places and in different ways. I would rather be\\nhere than anywhere else in the world.\" There was so much that was hopeless in his\\neyes that he did not want her to see. She would be quite capable, he\\ntold himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever\\nguessed. And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he\\nwould be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms. Everything was ready for her return to the hospital. She had been out\\nthat day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded\\nhands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now\\nher suit-case, packed, was in the hall. \"In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and\\nPalmer were not in the house. \"She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night\\nwhen you took care of Palmer\\'s arm before we got Dr. I often think,\\nK., what a good doctor you would have been. You knew so well what to do\\nfor mother.\" She still could not trust her voice about her mother. \"Palmer\\'s arm is going to be quite straight. Ed is so proud of Max\\nover it. Once at least, whenever they were\\ntogether, she brought Max into the conversation. He is\\ninteresting, don\\'t you think?\" \"Very,\" said K.\\n\\nTo save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice. It was not in human nature to expect more of him. \"Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you\\ntalk about? She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or\\nwhen Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the\\naccompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall. Max came in always, before he went,\\nand, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute\\nblankness of life in the hospital without her. \"I go every day because I must,\" he would assure her gayly; \"but, I tell\\nyou, the snap is gone out of it. When there was a chance that every cap\\nwas YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling.\" He\\nhad a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of\\nthe shoulders. he said--which, being translated, means:\\n\"What the devil\\'s the use!\" And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his\\nroom and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with\\nwhich he and Max had been working out a case. So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that\\nlast evening together. Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about\\nJohnny. Now that you are\\nsuch friends,\"--she eyed him wistfully,--\"perhaps some day you will come\\nto one of his operations. Even if you didn\\'t understand exactly, I know\\nit would thrill you. And--I\\'d like you to see me in my uniform, K. You\\nnever have.\" She grew a little sad as the evening went on. She was going to miss K.\\nvery much. While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to\\nlisten for him. She knew the way he slammed the front door. She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened\\nthe very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs\\nand call:--\\n\\n\"Ahoy, there!\" \"Aye, aye,\" she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper\\nresponse. Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had\\ndepended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads. He would miss her,\\ntoo; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max. Back in a circle\\nto Max, of course. She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight\\nushered in Christmas Day. Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having\\npresented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from\\nthe autumn\\'s business, had yawned herself to bed. When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start. She\\nrealized that neither of them had spoken, and that K. The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the\\nchurches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes. Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about\\nher. Sidney left the little house at\\nsix, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow. The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on\\nduty at seven o\\'clock. She had been assigned to the men\\'s surgical ward,\\nand went there at once. She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her\\nmother\\'s death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward. For the\\nsecond time in four months, the two girls were working side by side. Sidney\\'s recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her\\nnervous. \"We were all sorry to hear of your trouble,\" she said. \"I hope we shall\\nget on nicely.\" At the far end two cots\\nhad been placed. \"The ward is heavy, isn\\'t it?\" There are three of\\nus--you, myself, and a probationer.\" The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows. Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her\\nrecords. \"The probationer\\'s name is Wardwell,\" she said. \"Perhaps you\\'d better\\nhelp her with the breakfasts. If there\\'s any way to make a mistake, she\\nmakes it.\" It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld. His dark, heavily fringed eyes\\nlooked at her from a pale face. \"I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved. She had wished to go, but K.\\nhad urged against it. She was not strong, and she had already suffered\\nmuch. And now the work of the ward pressed hard. She stood beside him and stroked his hand. He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate\\nof a private patient to the free ward. \"Oh, I\\'m all right, Miss Sidney,\" he said. Howe is paying six\\ndollars a week for me. The difference between me and the other fellows\\naround here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don\\'t.\" \"Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some. I\\'m no bloated\\naristocrat; I don\\'t have to have a napkin.\" \"Have they told you what the trouble is?\" Max Wilson is going to\\noperate on me. What a thing it was\\nto be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld\\'s and make it\\nlife again! All sorts of men made up Sidney\\'s world: the derelicts who wandered\\nthrough the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the\\nunshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if\\nnot of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but\\nfilling no especial place in the world. Towering over them all was the\\nyounger Wilson. He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the\\nother men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power. Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face. \"When I was a kid,\" he said, \"and ran along the Street, calling Dr. Max\\na dude, I never thought I\\'d lie here watching that door to see him come\\nin. Ain\\'t it the hell of a world, anyhow? It\\nain\\'t much of a Christmas to you, either.\" Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up\\nwith tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as\\nshe might have been. When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled\\nup at her whimsically. As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day. The\\ninternes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in\\ntheir buttonholes, doing few dressings. Over the upper floors, where the\\nkitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting\\nturkeys. Every ward had its vase of holly. In the afternoon, services\\nwere held in the chapel downstairs. Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down\\nelevators. Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet\\nslippers. Outside the wide doors of the corridor\\nthe wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle. Behind them, dressed for\\nthe occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who\\ndrove the ambulance. On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in\\ncrisp caps and fresh uniforms. On the other side had been reserved a\\nplace for the staff. The internes stood back against the wall, ready to\\nrun out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance\\ncall, as the case might be. Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon. The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising\\nabove the rest. Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass\\nwindows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her\\ncap, always just a little awry. Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes\\nstraying toward her constantly. What\\na zest for living and for happiness she had! The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:\\n\\n\"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even\\nthy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\" She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of\\ngladness. And he--\\n\\nHis brother was singing. His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed\\nout above the sound of the small organ. Ed had been a good brother to\\nhim; he had been a good son. Max\\'s vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his\\nmother over his brother\\'s littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the\\ngirl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to\\nCarlotta last of all. He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line\\nof nurses. As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted\\nher head and glanced toward him. The nurses sang:--\\n\\n     \"O holy Child of Bethlehem! Descend to us, we pray;\\n      Cast out our sin, and enter in,\\n      Be born in us to-day.\" The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words. Ed\\'s\\nheavy throat shook with earnestness. The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and\\nweary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened. The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts. K. sent her\\na silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror. But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney\\'s eyes had glowed, was a\\ngreat box of roses marked in Dr. Max\\'s copper-plate writing, \"From a\\nneighbor.\" Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that\\nafternoon. Max was waiting for Sidney in the\\ncorridor. --she glanced down to the rose\\nshe wore. \"The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.\" \"They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a\\nchance to enjoy them.\" Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her. All the pretty\\nspeeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died\\nbefore her frank glance. There were many things he wanted to say to her. He wanted to tell her\\nthat he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without\\nher; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy\\nman to his hour before his saint. What he really said was to inquire\\npolitely whether she had had her Christmas dinner. Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt. Is it bad for discipline for us to be good\\nfriends?\" Something in her eyes roused\\nthe devil of mischief that always slumbered in him. \"My car\\'s been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,\\nand I have Ed\\'s Peggy in a sleigh. Put on your things and come for a\\nride.\" He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he\\nmaliciously raised his voice a trifle. Daniel went back to the bathroom. She was to be free that afternoon until six o\\'clock;\\nbut she had promised to go home. Ten to one, he\\'s with her now.\" The\\nheavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen\\nin the chapel; made her dizzy. And,\\nbesides, if K. were with Christine--\\n\\n\"It\\'s forbidden, isn\\'t it?\" \"And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!\" \"One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and\\nthen.\" Here was her old friend and\\nneighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride. The swift rebellion\\nof youth against authority surged up in Sidney. Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black\\ndespair. She knew very well what the issue would be. Sidney would drive\\nwith him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on\\nher face and the snow about her. The jerky motion of the little sleigh\\nwould throw them close together. He would\\ntouch Sidney\\'s hand daringly and smile in her eyes. That was his method:\\nto play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the\\ncloak dropped and the danger was there. The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went\\nback to it. On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair\\nof woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief. There were sprays of\\nholly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey\\nand ice-cream. The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the\\nward. She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the\\ninstant composing of the restless ward to peace. She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas\\nwas a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she\\nplayed cheerful things. The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across\\nfrom bed to bed. The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a\\nlong, pointed nose. She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to\\nthe music. \"Last Christmas,\" she said plaintively, \"we went out into the country\\nin a hay-wagon and had a real time. I don\\'t know what I am here for,\\nanyhow. \"Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that\\'s\\nthe sort of spread we have up in our part of the world. When I think of\\nwhat I sat down to to-day--!\" She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital\\ndiffered from Sidney\\'s in that it was to placate her superiors, while\\nSidney\\'s had been to care for her patients. Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip. She had idly\\nglued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was\\nscratching a skull and cross-bones on it. \"I wonder if you have noticed something,\" she said, eyes on the label. \"I have noticed that the three-o\\'clock medicines are not given,\" said\\nCarlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the\\nrounds of the ward. \"I\\'m no gossip,\" she said, putting the tray on the table. \"If you won\\'t\\nsee, you won\\'t. As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta\\npaid no attention to this. Miss Wardwell swelled with importance\\nand let her superior ask her twice. A hand seemed to catch Carlotta\\'s heart and hold it. Being an old friend doesn\\'t make you look at a girl as if you\\nwanted to take a bite out of her. Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she\\'ll\\nnever finish her training; she\\'ll marry him. I wish,\" concluded the\\nprobationer plaintively, \"that some good-looking fellow like that would\\ntake a fancy to me. I am as ugly as a mud fence, but\\nI\\'ve got style.\" She was long and sinuous, but she wore her\\nlanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction. Harriet Kennedy\\nwould have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long\\njade earrings, and made her a fashion. The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny\\nRosenfeld\\'s white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music. \"I\\'m twenty-one and she\\'s eighteen,\" hummed the\\nward under its breath. \"Lord, how I\\'d like to dance! If I ever get out of this charnel-house!\" The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta\\'s elbow; beside it the box of labels. Carlotta knew it down to the depths of\\nher tortured brain. As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was\\nlosing her game. She had lost already, unless--\\n\\nIf she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things. She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide\\napart. It was here that they met on common ground. The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the\\nearly winter twilight settled down. At five o\\'clock Carlotta sent Miss\\nWardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised\\nperson. The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly. Christmas was over,\\nand there were no evening papers to look forward to. Carlotta gave the five-o\\'clock medicines. Then she sat down at the table\\nnear the door, with the tray in front of her. There are certain thoughts\\nthat are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal\\ncord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically. Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in\\nher mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought. Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new\\nlabel for it, pasted it over the old one. Then she exchanged it for one\\nof the same size on the medicine tray. In the dining-room, at the probationers\\' table, Miss Wardwell was\\ntalking. \"Believe me,\" she said, \"me for the country and the simple life after\\nthis. They think I\\'m only a probationer and don\\'t see anything, but I\\'ve\\ngot eyes in my head. Wilson, and she\\nthinks I don\\'t see it. But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few\\nof the jolts she has given me.\" Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,\\nhastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way\\nagain. In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death\\nperhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and\\ncups of water to thirsty lips. In their eyes, as in Sidney\\'s, burned the\\nlight of service. But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,\\nwho had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the\\nlife, its limitations, its endless sacrifices. Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the\\nfearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the\\nbroad understanding of actual contact, still found it good. Fifty who\\nwere learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched\\nskirts from the drab of the streets. And the fifty, who found the very\\nscum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta\\nand, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone. They could not have\\nvoiced their reasons. The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their\\nskirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps. When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them. They did not like her,\\nand she knew it. Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the\\nmedicine-tray as she had left it. \"I guess I\\'ve fixed her,\" she said to herself. Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done. CHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nK. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day. This was when the gay\\nlittle sleigh had stopped in front of the house. Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment. Christine\\'s parlor was\\ngay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her\\ntea-cups. K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney\\nin the doorway, and leaped to his feet. \"I can\\'t come in,\" she cried. I am out\\nsleigh-riding with Dr. \"Ask him in for a cup of tea,\" Christine called out. \"Here\\'s Aunt\\nHarriet and mother and even Palmer!\" Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave\\nfront. Sidney ran to the front door and called: \"Will you come in for a cup of\\ntea?\" As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer. He had come out\\nin the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him. His arm\\nwas still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling. The sound of laughter came through the door faintly. The boy\\'s face was\\nalways with him. \"Better in some ways, but of course--\"\\n\\n\"When are they going to operate?\" \"He doesn\\'t seem to blame you; he says it\\'s all in the game.\" \"Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?\" \"If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said. Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer\\'s\\nface showed worn and haggard. He put his free hand on Sidney\\'s shoulder. \"I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--\"\\n\\n\"That would be cowardly, wouldn\\'t it?\" \"If Christine would only say something and get it over with! She doesn\\'t\\nsulk; I think she\\'s really trying to be kind. She turns pale every time I touch her hand.\" All the light had died out of Sidney\\'s face. Life was terrible, after\\nall--overwhelming. One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or\\none was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or\\nlike Aunt Harriet. Things were so different from\\nwhat they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and\\nlaughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed\\nand wretched. The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed\\nto move so calmly in his little orbit. He was always so steady, so\\nbalanced. If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths. \"There\\'s only one thing, Palmer,\" she said gravely. \"Johnny Rosenfeld\\nis going to have his chance. If anybody in the world can save him, Max\\nWilson can.\" The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh\\nagain. K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her. Is there any chance of having you home for supper?\" I am to go on duty at six again.\"\\'s eyes, she did not see it. He waved them\\noff smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the\\nhouse. \"Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?\" asked Max, as Peggy\\nstarted up the Street. \"No one that I know of, unless--\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. Unless--\"\\n\\n\"What I meant,\" she said with dignity, \"is that unless one counts very\\nyoung men, and that isn\\'t really love.\" \"We\\'ll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very\\nyoung. Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne? Any of the internes at\\nthe hospital?\" Le Moyne is not in love with me.\" There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved. K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction\\nfor women. He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained. And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught. \"Don\\'t you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?\" I am not in love with anybody; I haven\\'t time\\nto be in love. So warm did the argument become that\\nthey passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather\\nheavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his\\nhand a dilapidated leather bag. But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,\\nlooking ruefully after them. Ed\\'s mind, only a vague and\\ninarticulate regret. These things that came so easily to Max, the\\naffection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing\\nof Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his. If there was any faint\\nresentment, it was at himself. He had raised the boy wrong--he had\\ntaught him to be selfish. Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he\\nmade his slow progress up the Street. At something after two o\\'clock that night, K. put down his pipe\\nand listened. He had not been able to sleep since midnight. In his\\ndressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking. The content of his\\nfirst few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest. He\\nwho had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close\\ntouch with it; his eddy was deep with it. For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had\\ndone. It had taken courage, God knew,\\nto give up everything and come away. In a way, it would have taken more\\ncourage to have stayed. He had thought, at first, that he could\\nfight down this love for Sidney. The\\ninnocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her\\nin his arms after her mother\\'s death, the thousand small contacts of her\\nreturns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire. Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter\\ndays--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,\\nwith Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by\\nChristine\\'s fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and\\nwatching his grave profile and steady eyes. He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken\\nhimself. It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when\\nthe camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity\\nwhich would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight. Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking\\nout, tender lips smiling. When she was not at home, it sat on K.\\'s\\ndresser, propped against his collar-box. When she was in the house, it\\nlay under the pin-cushion. Two o\\'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the\\npicture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where\\nhe could see it. He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and\\nlooked at it. He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph\\nin his old life--trying to find a place for her. There had been few women in his old life. There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them\\nimpatiently out of his mind. Almost\\nbefore he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at\\nhis door outside. Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,\\na shawl about her shoulders. \"I\\'ve had word to go to the hospital,\" she said. \"I thought maybe you\\'d\\ngo with me. It seems as if I can\\'t stand it alone. \"Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?\" He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing. Rosenfeld\\'s sobs had become low moans; Christine stood\\nhelplessly over her. \"I am terribly sorry,\" she said--\"terribly sorry! When I think whose\\nfault all this is!\" Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine\\'s\\nfingers. I guess you and I\\nunderstand each other. K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny\\nhad been taken. Under the white lights his boyish figure looked\\nstrangely long. There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or\\nthree internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head. Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a\\nSidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide\\nand unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap. When he stood beside her,\\nshe did not move or look up. The group around the bed had parted to\\nadmit Mrs. Only Sidney and K. remained by\\nthe door, isolated, alone. \"You must not take it like that, dear. But, after\\nall, in that condition--\"\\n\\nIt was her first knowledge that he was there. Her voice was dreary, inflectionless. \"They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he\\'s dying; that I\\nmurdered him.\" I came on duty at six o\\'clock and gave the\\nmedicines. When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all\\nright. The medicine-tray was just as it should be. I\\nwent to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep. I didn\\'t give him\\nanything but what was on the tray,\" she finished piteously. \"I looked at\\nthe label; I always look.\" By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.\\'s eyes looked for a moment\\ndirectly into Carlotta\\'s. Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up\\nagain. It was well for Carlotta that it did. She looked as if she had\\nseen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled. \"Get some one to\\ntake her place.\" After all, the presence of this man in this room\\nat such a time meant nothing. He was Sidney\\'s friend, that was all. It was the boy\\'s weakened condition that was turning her\\nrevenge into tragedy. \"I am all right,\" she pleaded across the bed to the Head. He had done everything he knew without\\nresult. The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor. With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could\\nhave forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him\\nwith knotted towels dipped in ice-water. But the wrecked body on the bed\\ncould stand no such heroic treatment. It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld\\'s life. For, when\\nstaff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward\\nwith a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished. There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad. \"Try it, for Heaven\\'s sake,\" he said. The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at\\nlast, of odds and ends from the operating-room. K. did the work, his\\nlong fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs. Rosenfeld knelt by the bed\\nwith her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her\\nlittle chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the\\ncorridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the\\ndoor. When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows\\nhad turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the\\nmorning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first\\nwords that marked his return from the dark valley. When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the\\nbedside and went over to Sidney\\'s chair. \"He\\'s all right now,\" he said--\"as all right as he can be, poor lad!\" How strange that you should know such a thing. The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their\\ndining-room for early coffee. Wilson was giving a few last instructions\\nas to the boy\\'s care.\\'s hand and\\nheld it to her lips. The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,\\nfell away before her simple caress. \"My dear, my dear,\" he said huskily. \"Anything that I can do--for\\nyou--at any time--\"\\n\\nIt was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that\\nCarlotta Harrison and K. came face to face. Johnny was quite conscious\\nby that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful. \"More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!\" he\\nsaid to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and\\ncaresses. \"You were always a good boy, Johnny,\" she said. \"Just you get well\\nenough to come home. I\\'ll take care of you the rest of my life. We will\\nget you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in\\nthe park when I come from work.\" \"I\\'ll be passenger and you\\'ll be chauffeur, ma.\" Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again. With sixty-five\\ncents a day and what I make, we\\'ll get along.\" \"Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling\\n\\'mother\\' and\\'supper\\' in one breath!\" The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet. She had been\\nmaking a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind\\nduring all the night. It would be difficult to tell when he actually\\nknew her. When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been\\nmade, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were\\ntogether. K. stopped her on her way to the door. Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.\" \"I have not seen you since you left St. \"No; I--I rested for a few months.\" \"I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any\\nprevious hospital experience.\" \"I shall not tell them, of course.\" And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should\\nrespect the other\\'s confidence. There had been a time, just before dawn,\\nwhen she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at\\nthe end of a long night. The boy was\\nvery low, hardly breathing. Her past stretched behind her, a series of\\nsmall revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse. She would have given every hope she had in the\\nworld, just then, for Sidney\\'s stainless past. She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete\\nself-revelation. And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night\\'s struggle had\\nbeen in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained\\nnothing by what he had suffered. The whole night had shown her the\\nhopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance. She\\nhad surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney\\'s slender figure\\nas she made her way up the stairs to her room. Never, in all his past\\novertures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes. CHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nTo Harriet Kennedy, Sidney\\'s sentence of thirty days\\' suspension came\\nas a blow. K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for\\nSidney\\'s arrival. The little household was sharing in Harriet\\'s prosperity. Katie had\\na helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi. And Harriet had\\nestablished on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee. It was\\nover the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement. \"What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days? \"Not ill, although she is not quite well. The fact is, Harriet,\"--for\\nit was \"Harriet\" and \"K.\" by this time,--\"there has been a sort of\\nsemi-accident up at the hospital. It hasn\\'t resulted seriously, but--\"\\n\\nHarriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him. \"There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that\\'s\\nall.\" \"She\\'d better come home and stay home,\" said Harriet shortly. \"I hope it\\ndoesn\\'t get in the papers. This dressmaking business is a funny sort of\\nthing. One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd\\'s off\\nsomewhere else.\" \"There\\'s nothing against Sidney,\" K. reminded her. It seems it\\'s a\\nmere matter of discipline. Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let\\nsuch a thing go by. But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney.\" However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl\\'s arrival, all she\\nhad meant to say fled when she saw Sidney\\'s circled eyes and pathetic\\nmouth. And took her corseted\\nbosom. For the time at least, Sidney\\'s world had gone to pieces about her. All\\nher brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace. When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked\\nfor just that one evening alone. But after Harriet had retired, and\\nMimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to\\nGratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall. Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone\\nto bed; but K.\\'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom. Sidney\\ntiptoed to the door. \"May I come in and talk to you?\" He turned and took a quick survey of the room. The picture was against\\nthe collar-box. But he took the risk and held the door wide. Sidney came in and sat down by the fire. By being adroit he managed to\\nslip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it. It is\\ndoubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it. \"I\\'ve been thinking things over,\" she said. \"It seems to me I\\'d better\\nnot go back.\" \"That would be foolish, wouldn\\'t it, when you have done so well? And,\\nbesides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t do it!\" I can\\'t keep on; that\\'s all there is to it. All\\nlast night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going. I\\nkept saying to myself: \\'You didn\\'t do it, you didn\\'t do it\\'; and all the\\ntime something inside of me was saying, \\'Not now, perhaps; but sometime\\nyou may.\\'\" Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the\\nsame impasse! \"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one\\'s hand,\\nand then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!\" She looked up at\\nhim forlornly. \"I am just not brave enough, K.\" \"Wouldn\\'t it be braver to keep on? Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and\\nempty place. And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were\\nready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly. \"I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay. Nobody really\\nwants me anywhere--in all the world! Not at the hospital, not here, not\\nanyplace. \"When you say that nobody wants you,\" said K., not very steadily, \"I--I\\nthink you are making a mistake.\" The only person\\nwho ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!\" She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not\\nunderstand, she  suddenly. \"No; I do not mean Joe Drummond.\" If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on\\nrecklessly; but her blank eyes warned him. \"If you mean Max Wilson,\" said Sidney, \"you are entirely wrong. He\\'s not\\nin love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a\\ndozen girls. He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn\\'t\\nmean--anything else. Anyhow, after this disgrace--\"\\n\\n\"There is no disgrace, child.\" \"He\\'ll think me careless, at the least. \"You say he likes to be with you. Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire. She rose with a\\nsudden passionate movement. In the informality of the household, she,\\nhad visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood\\nbefore him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown\\nacross her breast. \"I worship him, K.,\" she said tragically. \"When I see him coming, I want\\nto get down and let him walk on me. John moved to the bedroom. I\\nknow the very way he rings for the elevator. When I see him in the\\noperating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and\\nexcited, he--he looks like a god.\" Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood\\ngazing at the small coal fire. It was as well for K. that she did not\\nsee his face. For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in\\nhis eyes. He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,\\nthe collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which\\nReginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with\\npipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,\\nstooped and weary. \"You\\'re sure it\\'s not\\njust--glamour, Sidney?\" Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that\\nshe was crying. Tears, of course, except in the privacy\\nof one\\'s closet, were not ethical on the Street. \"Give me a handkerchief,\" said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little\\nscene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer. Then:\\n\\n\"It\\'s all over, anyhow, since this. If he\\'d really cared he\\'d have come\\nover to-night. Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension. She would never\\ngo back, she said passionately. She was innocent, had been falsely\\naccused. If they could think such a thing about her, she didn\\'t want to\\nbe in their old hospital. K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing. I have given him his medicines dozens of times.\" \"Who else had access to the medicine closet?\" \"Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course. I was off duty from four\\nto six. When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.\" \"Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you\\nharm?\" \"None whatever,\" began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking\\nherself,--\"unless--but that\\'s rather ridiculous.\" \"I\\'ve sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly\\nfair with me. Even if she--if she--\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" Wilson, I don\\'t believe--Why, K., she wouldn\\'t! \"Murder, of course,\" said K., \"in intention, anyhow. I\\'m only trying to find out whose mistake it was.\" Soon after that she said good-night and went out. She turned in the\\ndoorway and smiled tremulously back at him. \"You have done me a lot of good. With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed\\nthe door and slipped back into the room. K., hearing the door close,\\nthought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair. said Sidney suddenly from behind him,\\nand, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek. The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone\\nto such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him. On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,\\nwakened to the glare of his light over the transom. \"I wish you wouldn\\'t go to\\nsleep and let your light burn!\" K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his\\ndoor. \"I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light. Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and\\nsurveyed himself in the glass. Two nights without sleep and much anxiety\\nhad told on him. He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired. Mentally he\\ncompared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,\\nalmost insolent. Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness\\nof his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss. He drew a long breath and proceeded\\nto undress in the dark. Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day. She would have avoided\\nhim if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir\\nbefore she had time to escape. She had not seen the boy for two months,\\nand the change in him startled her. He was thinner, rather hectic,\\nscrupulously well dressed. she said, and then: \"Won\\'t you sit down?\" He dramatized himself, as he had that\\nnight the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him. He offered no conventional greeting whatever;\\nbut, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her\\neyes:--\\n\\n\"You\\'re not going back to that place, of course?\" \"Then somebody\\'s got to decide for you. The thing for you to do is to\\nstay right here, Sidney. Nobody here\\nwould ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody.\" In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little. It was a mistake about the\\nmedicines. His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she\\nhad not spoken. \"You give me the word and I\\'ll go and get your things; I\\'ve got a car of\\nmy own now.\" \"But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right. Whoever made\\nit, there was a mistake.\" \"You don\\'t mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing? Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on\\nyou?\" I can\\'t talk to you\\nif you explode like a rocket all the time.\" Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect. He advanced into the room, but\\nhe still scorned a chair. \"I guess you\\'ve been wondering why you haven\\'t heard from me,\" he said. \"I\\'ve seen you more than you\\'ve seen me.\" The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and\\nto have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was\\ndisconcerting. \"I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe. It\\'s so silly of\\nyou, really. It\\'s not because you care for me; it\\'s really because you\\ncare for yourself.\" \"You can\\'t look at me and say that, Sid.\" He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was\\nvery loose. \"I\\'m just eating my heart out for you, and that\\'s the truth. Everywhere I go, people say, \\'There\\'s the fellow Sidney\\nPage turned down when she went to the hospital.\\' I\\'ve got so I keep off\\nthe Street as much as I can.\" This wild, excited boy was not\\nthe doggedly faithful youth she had always known. It seemed to her\\nthat he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully\\nrepressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could\\nnot cope with. \"But what do you want me to do? If you\\'d\\nonly sit down--\"\\n\\n\"I want you to come home. I just want\\nyou to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be. Now\\nthat they have turned you out--\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ve done nothing of the sort. \"Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected\\nwith the hospital?\" Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless. She had\\ncome through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest. \"If it will make you understand things any better,\" she cried, \"I am\\ngoing back for both reasons!\" But her words seemed, surprisingly\\nenough, to steady him. \"Then, as far as I am concerned, it\\'s all over, is it?\" Suddenly:--\\n\\n\"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don\\'t you? Well,\\nif you take Max Wilson, you\\'re going to have more trouble than Christine\\never dreamed of. I can tell you some things about him now that will make\\nyou think twice.\" \"Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,\\nJoe,\" she said. \"Real men do not say those things about each other under\\nany circumstances. I don\\'t want you to\\ncome back until you have grown up.\" He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door. \"I guess I AM crazy,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been wanting to go away, but mother\\nraises such a fuss--I\\'ll not annoy you any more.\" He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward\\nher. \"Reginald,\" he said solemnly. Some boys caught\\nhim in the park, and I brought him home.\" He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her\\nhand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street. At the foot of\\nthe steps he almost collided with Dr. I\\'m glad\\nyou\\'ve made it up.\" CHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\nWinter relaxed its clutch slowly that year. March was bitterly cold;\\neven April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with\\nice. But at mid-day there was spring in the air. In the courtyard of the\\nhospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins. The\\nfountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired. Here and there on\\nward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun. Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden\\nwith new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm. She carried out and\\nplanted flowers on her sister\\'s grave, and went back to her work with a\\nfeeling of duty done. A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground\\nhad given her an inspiration for a gown. She drew it in pencil on an\\nenvelope on her way back in the street car. Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to\\nthe spring cottons. The day she\\nsold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy. Once\\na customer brought her a bunch of primroses. All day she kept them under\\nthe counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny\\nRosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital. On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily. Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more\\nthoughtful.\\'s guidance, she\\nhad given up the \"Duchess\" and was reading real books. She was thinking\\nreal thoughts, too, for the first time in her life. Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her\\neyes; her voice had deepened. Where she had been a pretty girl, she\\nwas now lovely. She was back in the hospital again, this time in the\\nchildren\\'s ward. K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket\\nof fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her\\neyes that he had never seen before. It hurt him, rather--things being as\\nthey were with him. With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh\\nactivities. Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness. She\\nscrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again\\nfreshly starched. It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a\\nremedy for her uneasiness. The impeccable character of the little\\nhouse had been against it. Schwitter had a little bar and\\nserved the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had\\nbeen known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had\\nalready overindulged. The word went about that Schwitter\\'s was no place\\nfor a good time. Even Tillie\\'s chicken and waffles failed against this\\nhandicap. By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done. One or two motor\\nparties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone\\nback to the city again. The\\nroads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,\\nand still business continued dull. By the first day of May, Tillie\\'s uneasiness had become certainty. Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her\\nsitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron. He put down the\\nmilk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head. \"I guess there\\'s no mistake, then?\" \"There\\'s no mistake,\" said poor Tillie into her apron. He bent down and kissed the back of her neck. Then, when she failed to\\nbrighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,\\nand rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way. The\\ntea-kettle had boiled dry. Then:--\\n\\n\"Do you want to see a doctor?\" \"I\\'d better see somebody,\" she said, without looking up. \"And--don\\'t\\nthink I\\'m blaming you. As far as\\nthat goes, I\\'ve wanted a child right along. It isn\\'t the trouble I am\\nthinking of either.\" He made some tea\\nclumsily and browned her a piece of toast. When he had put them on one\\nend of the kitchen table, he went over to her again. \"I guess I\\'d ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of\\nwas trying to get a little happiness out of life. And,\"--he stroked\\nher arm,--\"as far as I am concerned, it\\'s been worth while, Tillie. No\\nmatter what I\\'ve had to do, I\\'ve always looked forward to coming back\\nhere to you in the evening. Maybe I don\\'t say it enough, but I guess you\\nknow I feel it all right.\" Without looking up, she placed her hand over his. \"I guess we started wrong,\" he went on. \"You can\\'t build happiness on\\nwhat isn\\'t right. You and I can manage well enough; but now that there\\'s\\ngoing to be another, it looks different, somehow.\" After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically. The hope of\\nmotherhood alternated with black fits of depression. She sang at her\\nwork, to burst out into sudden tears. Schwitter had given up his nursery\\nbusiness; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back. When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country\\nfor orders, he was too late. Other nurserymen had been before him;\\nshrubberies and orchards were already being set out. The second payment\\non his mortgage would be due in July. By the middle of May they were\\nfrankly up against it. Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into\\nwords. \"We\\'re not making good, Til,\" he said. We are too decent; that\\'s what\\'s the matter with us.\" With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life. \"We\\'ll have to keep a sort of hotel,\" he said lamely. \"Sell to everybody\\nthat comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--\"\\n\\nTillie\\'s white face turned crimson. \"If it\\'s bad weather, and they\\'re married--\"\\n\\n\"How are we to know if they are married or not?\" But the\\nsituation was not less acute. There were two or three unfurnished rooms\\non the second floor. He began to make tentative suggestions as to their\\nfurnishing. Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried\\nto hide it from her. She burned it in the kitchen\\nstove. Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him. Other people\\nfattened on the frailties of human nature. Two miles away, on the other\\nroad, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars\\nprofit the year before. He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping\\nhis wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the\\nasylum. Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three\\npeople dependent upon him. One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his\\nclothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous\\nfingers. Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the \"Climbing Rose,\"\\ntwo miles away. Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were\\nparked before the barn. From the bar came\\nthe jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation. When Schwitter turned the horse\\'s head back toward Hillfoot, his\\nmind was made up. He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a\\nbarkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a\\nsecond-hand piano somewhere. When she found him\\ndetermined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated. She\\ncould not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little\\nhouse. When, a week after Schwitter\\'s visit to the \"Climbing Rose,\" an\\ninstallment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie\\nmoved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there\\nestablished herself. \"I am not leaving you,\" she told him. \"I don\\'t even know that I am\\nblaming you. But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and\\nthat\\'s flat.\" So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,\\nstopped astounded in the road. The weather was warm, and he carried\\nhis Norfolk coat over his arm. The little house was bustling; a dozen\\nautomobiles were parked in the barnyard. The bar was crowded, and a\\nbarkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference\\nof his kind. There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new\\nsign on the gate. Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity. Over his schooner of beer\\nK. gathered something of the story. \"I\\'m not proud of it, Mr. I\\'ve come to do a good many things\\nthe last year or so that I never thought I would do. First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after\\nthat nothing went right. Then there were things coming on\"--he looked at\\nK. anxiously--\"that meant more expense. I would be glad if you wouldn\\'t\\nsay anything about it at Mrs. \"I\\'ll not speak of it, of course.\" It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr. Schwitter\\'s unhappiness\\nbecame more apparent. \"She wouldn\\'t stand for it,\" he said. \"She moved out the day I furnished\\nthe rooms upstairs and got the piano.\" I--I\\'ll take you\\nout there, if you would like to see her.\" K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under\\nthe circumstances. \"I guess I can find her,\" he said, and rose from the little table. \"If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I\\'d appreciate it. Of course, she understands how I am driven. But--especially if you would\\ntell her that the Street doesn\\'t know--\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do all I can,\" K. promised, and followed the path to the barn. The little harness-room\\nwas very comfortable. A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with\\na mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the\\nroom. \"I wouldn\\'t stand for it,\" she said simply; \"so here I am.

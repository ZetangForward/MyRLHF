45,no,"To the south of the hallway is the bathroom. There was reason for these gardens being so grand, for the public park was systematically robbed of its best to make them so. There was a lake in the park where large numbers of ducks and geese were kept at the ratepayers' expense. About a month ago some venetian blinds were taken to the paint-shop down at the yard to be repainted and re-harnessed, and since then nothing had been heard of them by the men working at the 'Cave'. The venetian blind maker, Latham, had been waiting to hear from Rushton about the blinds for ""The Cave"". Rushton was seen kissing and embracing Miss Wade, the young lady clerk, by Crass, Budd, and Slyme. Slyme and Crass were painting the venetian blinds belonging to 'The Cave' in a workshop. The apprentice, Bert, spent most of his time in the workshop cleaning out pots and pails. Crass and Slyme made a fire in the workshop to keep warm while they worked on the blinds. Ruth was left at home alone with the baby. Easton and Ruth went marketing together and on their way home they met Mr and Mrs Crass, who invited them to the 'Cricketers' for a drink. At the 'Cricketers', Ruth was made to drink more beer and spirits than she wanted. Easton pushed Ruth away when she wanted to go home. Ruth left the pub and was found in a faint outside an empty house by Slyme, who helped her home. The work at 'The Cave' was progressing rapidly. The outside work was nearly finished, but the painting of the kitchen was delayed due to the non-arrival of the new cooking range. Harlow and Philpot were painting the basement windows in a trench filled with filth. Owen, Easton, Sawkins, and the other men were working on different parts of the outside of the house. The weather was bitterly cold and the men were suffering from the cold. They discussed the unfairness of the work distribution and the principle of the present system. Crass hoped to use the conversation to bring up the Obscurer cutting. Owen gave a lecture on the cause of poverty, stating that it was not due to a lack of raw materials, labour, or machinery, but the imbecile money system.

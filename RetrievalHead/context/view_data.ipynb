       "{'input': 'Sandra went to the garden. \"Yes,\" replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,\\n\"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other\\nthings, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel. All I can now say is that,\\nin his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of\\nsaying\\'my boy\\'); and they ought to love each other like brothers. Oh, my\\nbrave, brave wife!\" said Dagobert, with emotion, \"you did a good thing,\\npoor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with\\nyour own.\" \"Don\\'t talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.\" \"You are right; but I\\'ll make you amends for it by and by. \\'Tis down to\\nyour account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow\\nmorning.\" cried the blacksmith; \"who\\'ll say, after\\nthis, that there are not days set apart for happiness? How came you to\\nmeet him, father?\" \"I\\'ll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if\\nyou expect to sleep, you are mistaken. You\\'ll give me half your room, and\\na fine chat we\\'ll have. Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is\\naccustomed to sleep at the children\\'s door.\" \"Dear me, love, I think of nothing. But, at such a moment, if you and the\\nyoung ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the\\ncook-shop.\" \"No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.\" \"You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm\\nyou a little, my dear young ladies,\" said Frances; \"unfortunately, I have\\nnothing else to offer you.\" \"You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to\\nbed; while they do so, I\\'ll go to my boy\\'s room, and, before Rose and\\nBlanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give\\nAgricola a respite.\" \"It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her,\" said Agricola. \"But I think she was here when my husband came in,\" added Frances. \"Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:\\nshe is so thoughtful. But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.\" \"Go and see who it is, then, Agricola.\" Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with\\na respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking\\nfor a moment at Rose and Blanche. \"Allow me to observe, sir,\" said Agricola, \"that after knocking, you\\nmight have waited till the door was opened, before you entered. \"Pray excuse me, sir,\" said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,\\nperhaps to prolong his stay in the room: \"I beg a thousand pardons--I\\nregret my intrusion--I am ashamed--\"\\n\\n\"Well, you ought to be, sir,\" said Agricola, with impatience, \"what do\\nyou want?\" \"Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?\" Sandra got the milk. \"No, sir; upstairs,\" said Agricola. \"Really, sir,\" cried the polite man, with low bows, \"I am quite abroad at\\nmy blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person. Daniel travelled to the kitchen. I brought\\nher proposals for work from a very respectable party.\" \"It is very late, sir,\" said Agricola, with surprise. \"But that young\\nperson is as one of our family. Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to\\nnight; she is gone to bed.\" \"Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--\"\\n\\n\"Enough, sir,\" said Agricola, taking a step towards the door. \"I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be\\nassured that--\"\\n\\n\"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse\\nthe length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!\" Daniel travelled to the garden. Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed\\nhis moustache with pride. \"But that does not\\nastonish you--you are used to it.\" During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again\\ndirected a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and\\nDagobert. In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground\\nfor herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,\\nassisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola\\nhaving previously withdrawn to their garret. Just as the blacksmith, who\\npreceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother\\nBunch\\'s room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him\\nrapidly, in a low tone:\\n\\n\"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you.\" These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did\\nnot hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old\\nsoldier said to him,\\n\\n\"Well, boy, what is it?\" \"Nothing, father,\" said the blacksmith, turning round; \"I feared I did\\nnot light you well.\" \"Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to\\nnight;\" and the soldier, not noticing his son\\'s surprise, went into the\\nlittle room where they were both to pass the night. On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over\\npolite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street. He advanced\\ntowards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square. In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak. \"The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances\\nBaudoin\\'s; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep\\nwith her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will\\nshare the young blacksmith\\'s room.\" \"I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on\\nthe subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to\\nlearn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the\\npost about the young blacksmith.\" John took the apple. And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin\\'s\\nconfessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at\\nRue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment. Should I not be returned, he will wait for me. You will tell him it\\nis on a matter of great moment.\" \"All shall be faithfully executed,\" said the ceremonious man, cringing to\\nRodin, as the coach drove quickly away. Mary went to the office. AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH. Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described\\nthe most profound silence reigned in the soldier\\'s humble dwelling. A\\nflickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,\\nbetrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy\\nrecess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except\\nby this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with\\nthe roof. A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so\\nnearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be\\nseated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed. The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl\\nwas carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a\\nlinen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple\\ncalix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were\\nfeebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle. The sempstress, who\\nhad taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks\\nwere downcast, and her eyes full of tears. She supported herself with one\\nhand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened\\nwith painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of\\nAgricola. The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,\\nusually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion\\nby which she was agitated. John travelled to the bedroom. Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a\\nletter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by\\npost in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the\\nhousekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some\\ntrivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his\\nfamily. Mary went to the garden. After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly\\nopened. she exclaimed, and Agricola immediately entered. \"I waited till my father went to sleep,\" said the blacksmith, in a low\\nvoice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness. \"But\\nwhat is the matter, my good sister? said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she\\nhastily presented to him the open letter. Agricola held it towards the\\nlight, and read what follows:\\n\\n\"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the\\nsisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you. That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of\\nto-morrow.\" exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied\\namazement. quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands. Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his\\neyes:-\"The song, entitled \\'Working-men Freed,\\' has been declared\\nlibellous. Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a\\nsecret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as\\nbeing concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy.\" said the girl, melting into tears, \"now I see it all. Mary discarded the apple. The man who\\nwas lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,\\ndoubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home.\" My verses\\nbreathe nothing but philanthropy. Am I to blame, if they have been found\\namong the papers of a secret society?\" Agricola disdainfully threw the\\nletter upon the table. \"If you wish it,\" said Agricola, \"I will; no time is lost.\" He resumed the reading of the letter:\\n\\n\"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin. There is mo\\ndoubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be\\nwell if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in\\norder that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to\\ntrial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,\\nwhose sole support he is. \"A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown.\" After a moment\\'s silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance\\nresumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: \"Reassure yourself, good\\nMother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on\\nme. It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the\\ntime.\" \"Agricola, for the love of heaven!\" said the girl, in a supplicating\\ntone; \"treat not the warning thus lightly. Believe in my forebodings, and\\nlisten to my advice.\" \"I tell you again, my good girl,\" replied Agricola, \"that it is two\\nmonths since my song was published. Sandra went back to the hallway. It is not in any way political;\\nindeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming\\ndown on me.\" \"But,\" said the other, \"you forget that new events have arisen. It is\\nscarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very\\nneighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires. Mary moved to the garden. And,\" continued she, \"if the\\nverses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the\\npossession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more\\nis necessary to compromise you in the plot.\" in which I only praise the\\nlove of labor and of goodness! If so, justice\\nwould be but a blind noodle. That she might grope her way, it would be\\nnecessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim\\'s staff to guide her\\nsteps.\" \"Agricola,\" resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on\\nhearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, \"I conjure you to listen to\\nme! No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you\\ndo also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor\\nlaborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;\\nyou recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble\\nheart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and\\nthe wicked. In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your\\nwishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than\\nyou, have not generous M. Hardy for employer. Daniel took the football. Say, Agricola, in these\\ntimes of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than\\nthat numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the\\npersons who have been apprehended?\" Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an\\nexcellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view\\nwith more seriousness the advice which she had given him. Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: \"And\\nthen, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.\" Sandra went to the kitchen. \"Yes,\" resumed the sempstress; \"a letter of his, a letter in itself quite\\ninsignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for\\nconspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.\" \"That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and\\nhe was set at liberty.\" \"Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has\\nfurnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself! These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola. He took up the\\nletter and again read it attentively. John moved to the bedroom. \"And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?\" Sandra took the milk. \"I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be\\nnaturally accounted for. Sandra put down the apple there. what a blow it would be for your father,\\nand poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything. consider, then, what would become of them\\nwithout you--without your labor!\" \"It would indeed be terrible,\" said Agricola, impatiently casting the\\nletter upon the table. \"What you have said concerning Remi is too true. He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error\\nthough it be, is not the less cruel. But they don\\'t commit a man without\\nhearing him.\" \"But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards,\" said Mother Bunch,\\nbitterly; \"and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty. And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his\\ndaily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in\\nprison? They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!\" At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled. \"A month without work,\" he said, with a sad and thoughtful air. \"And my\\nmother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family\\nuntil the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon. That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!\" exclaimed the girl impetuously; \"suppose you apply to M.\\nHardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,\\nthat, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their\\npersecution?\" \"Unfortunately,\" replied Agricola, \"M. Hardy is absent; he is on a\\njourney with Marshal Simon.\" After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,\\nadded: \"But no! After all, I had\\nrather await what may come. I\\'ll at least have the chance of proving my\\ninnocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it\\nbe that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my\\nfamily will be equally prevented.\" that is true,\" said the poor girl; \"what is to be done! \"My brave father,\" said Agricola to himself, \"if this misfortune happen\\nto-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep\\nso joyously!\" The blacksmith buried his face in his hands. Unhappily Mother Bunch\\'s fears were too well-founded, for it will be\\nrecollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue\\ndes Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made\\namong the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against\\ndemocratical ideas. Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some\\nseconds. Mary travelled to the office. A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an\\nindefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope. \"Agricola, you are saved!\" \"The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower\" (she\\nshowed it to the blacksmith) \"who has known how to make reparation with\\nso much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a\\ngenerous heart. You must apply to her--\"\\n\\nWith these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort\\nover herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks. For the first time in\\nher life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy. Another woman\\nwas so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she\\nidolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched. \"But what could be done\\nwith this young lady?\" \"Did she not say to you,\" answered Mother Bunch, \"\\'Remember my name; and\\nin all circumstances address yourself to me?\\'\" \"This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful\\nconnections who will be able to protect and defend you. Go to her to\\nmorrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her\\nsupport.\" Sandra left the milk. \"But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?\" I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had\\nsaved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for\\nhim. It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your\\ninnocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you\\nwill have nothing more to fear.\" said Agricola, \"to ask so great a service from a person\\nto whom one is almost unknown is hard.\" \"Believe me, Agricola,\" said the other sadly, \"I would never counsel what\\ncould possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you\\nunderstand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady. I do not propose\\nthat you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety\\nfor you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your\\nemployment, so that the family may not be without resources. John discarded the football there. Believe me,\\nAgricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is\\nnoble and becoming upon your part. Mary grabbed the apple. The heart of the young lady is\\ngenerous. The required surety will be\\nas nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be\\nthe very life to those who depend upon you.\" Sandra travelled to the office. \"You are right, my good sister,\" said Agricola, with sadness and\\ndejection. \"It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step. If the\\nyoung lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will\\nindeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event. added he, rising, \"I\\'d never dare to make the request to her! What is the insignificant service that I\\nrendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?\" \"Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the\\nservices which ought to be rendered, by those previously received? Trust\\nto me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart. I am, it is\\ntrue, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any\\nother person. I am nothing, and I can do nothing. Nevertheless, I am\\nsure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far\\nabove me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;\\nyes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel\\none; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that\\nwhich I would do, if, alas! I could do anything more than uselessly\\nconsume myself with regrets.\" In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so\\nheart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which\\nthis unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,\\nmade of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent\\nyouth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,\\nholding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,\\n\"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and\\ndelicacy!\" \"Unhappily,\" said the weeping girl, \"I can do nothing more than advise.\" \"And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear. They are those\\nof a soul the most elevated I have ever known. Yes, you have won me over\\ninto making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de\\nCardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!\" At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,\\nthe sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely\\nsweet and consoling were her emotions. If some poor creatures, fatally\\ndevoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,\\nthey sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the\\nworld is equally ignorant. The least word of true tenderness and\\naffection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably\\nblissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to\\nhardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of\\nthemselves. \"Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young\\nlady\\'s house?\" exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope. \"And,\" she quickly added, \"at break of day I\\'ll go down to watch at the\\nstreet-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you\\nof what I perceive.\" \"It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your\\nfather,\" said the hunchback. \"The quarter in which the young lady dwells,\\nis so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your\\npresent concealment.\" \"I think I hear the voice of my father,\" said Agricola suddenly. In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola\\'s garret, that he and\\nthe sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:\\n\\n\"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy? Sandra grabbed the apple. Why, my first sleep is\\nover; and my tongue itches deucedly.\" said Mother Bunch; \"your absence would disquiet\\nhim. On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether\\nor not I shall have seen anything suspicious.\" \"Why, Agricola, you are not here?\" resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice. \"Here I am, father,\" said the smith, while going out of the sempstress\\'s\\napartment, and entering the garret, to his father. \"I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest\\nits noise should disturb you.\" \"Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me,\" said Dagobert,\\ngayly; \"it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you. Oh, my\\ndear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not\\nseen his son for eighteen years.\" John journeyed to the office. \"Shall I light a candle, father?\" \"No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark. It will be a\\nnew pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak. It will be\\nlike seeing you for the first time twice.\" The door of Agricola\\'s garret\\nbeing now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more. The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed\\nnot an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in\\norder that she might watch over the safety of Agricola. However, in spite\\nof her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to\\nsink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy. She compared the\\nconversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom\\nshe secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she\\npossessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she\\nloved, with a chaste and devoted flame! But soon sinking into belief that\\nshe should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found\\nconsolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola. At the dawn of day,\\nshe rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order\\nto see if anything menaced Agricola from without. The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear\\nand cold towards morning. Through the glazed skylight of Agricola\\'s\\ngarret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be\\nseen. The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the\\nsewing-girl\\'s. For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which\\nAgricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a\\nnail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the\\npeople revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has\\ndelighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their\\nreverses. Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had\\nalready risen. The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his\\ninquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears. Sandra discarded the milk there. The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number\\nof precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of\\nAgricola\\'s song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the\\ndisconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the\\nyoung blacksmith. His father, however, as we have already mentioned,\\nsuspected not his secret anguish. Seated by the side of his son, upon the\\nedge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had\\ndressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both\\nthose of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to\\ndiscontinue the contemplation of his boy. \"You will laugh at me, my dear boy,\" said Dagobert to his son; \"but I\\nwished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in\\nfull day, as I now see you. But all in good time; I have lost nothing. Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear\\nmoustaches. What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made! Tell me;\\nhave you never had a wish to be a soldier?\" \"That\\'s right,\" said Dagobert: \"and besides, I believe, after all, look\\nye, that the time of the sword has gone by. We old fellows are now good\\nfor nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney. Like rusty old\\ncarbines, we have had our day.\" \"Yes; your days of heroism and of glory,\" said Agricola with excitement;\\nand then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, \"it is\\nsomething good and cheering to be your son!\" \"As to the good, I know nothing of that,\" replied Dagobert; \"but as for\\nthe cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly. And I think this\\nis but the beginning! I am like the famished\\nwretches who have been some days without food. It is but by little and\\nlittle that they recover themselves, and can eat. Now, you may expect to\\nbe tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day. No,\\nI wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and\\nperplexes me; and I am no longer myself.\" These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola. He believed\\nthat they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was\\nmenaced. \"Well,\" continued Dagobert; \"you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good\\nto you.\" Daniel moved to the bedroom. replied Agricola: \"there is none in the world better, or more\\nequitable and generous! If you knew what wonders he has brought about in\\nhis factory! Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies\\nof Lucifer!\" \"You shall see,\" resumed Agricola, \"what welfare, what joy, what\\naffection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;\\nwho work with an ardent pleasure. \"This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician,\" said Dagobert. \"He is, father, a very great magician. He has known how to render labor\\npleasant and attractive. As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,\\nhe accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;\\nwhence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work. And that\\nis not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in\\nwhich all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful\\nand salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an\\nassociation. But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!\" \"They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,\"\\nobserved Dagobert. Sandra took the apple there. \"Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good\\nmother!\" \"No, father, we will never separate again,\" said Agricola, stifling a\\nsigh. \"My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have\\nsuffered.\" exclaimed Dagobert, \"who the deuce has suffered? Look me well\\nin the face; and see if I have a look of suffering! Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again! You\\nshall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out! I wager that in\\nbeholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold\\nfather and son! But let us settle what we are to do with the day. You\\nwill write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his\\ngrand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should\\nhasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which\\nare of great importance for them. While you are writing, I will go down\\nto say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones. We will then\\neat a morsel. Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes\\nto be regular at that: the good soul! no great harm, if it amuse her! and\\nduring her absence, we will make a raid together.\" \"Father,\" said Agricola, with embarrassment, \"this morning it is out of\\nmy power to accompany you.\" said Dagobert; \"recollect this is Monday!\" \"Yes, father,\" said Agricola, hesitatingly; \"but I have promised to\\nattend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required\\nin a hurry. If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.\\nHardy. \"That alters the case,\" said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret. \"I thought\\nto make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must\\nbe deferred in favor of your work. John dropped the football. It is sacred: since it is that which\\nsustains your mother. Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious. See how quickly one gets habituated to and\\nspoilt by happiness. I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put\\noff for a few hours! I who, during eighteen years, have only\\nhoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it! Vive l\\'amour et cogni--I mean--my\\nAgricola!\" John got the football. And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his\\nson\\'s shoulder. John got the football. This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one\\nmoment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized. \"Now\\nthat I have recovered myself,\" said Dagobert, laughing, \"let us speak of\\nbusiness. Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in\\nParis?\" \"I don\\'t know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.\" \"My reason is,\" resumed Dagobert, \"that I sent from Russia by post, and\\nby order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some\\nimportant papers to a Parisian notary. As it was my duty to see this\\nnotary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his\\naddress in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my\\njourney; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,\\nthat if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect\\nit.\" Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start. He\\ninvoluntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension. His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had\\nnot perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: \"Come in!\" He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed\\nhat. To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,\\nwere two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as\\nthought.--\"My brother!\" Mary journeyed to the hallway. Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,\\nwhile they were locked in a close embrace. Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes\\nbecome moist. There was something truly touching in the affection of the\\nyoung men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and\\naspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola\\ncontrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel. \"I was forewarned by my father of your arrival,\" said the blacksmith at\\nlength. \"I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a\\nhundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping\\nfor it.\" asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands\\nof Dagobert. \"I trust that you have found her in good health.\" replied Dagobert; \"and her health will have become a\\nhundred times better, now that we are all together. Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting\\nhis fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of\\nineffable affection, Dagobert added:\\n\\n\"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel\\nhas the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he\\nsaved the lives of Marshal Simon\\'s daughters, and tried to save mine\\nalso.\" suddenly exclaimed\\nAgricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the\\nmissionary. Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly\\nbeneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through\\nwhich shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which\\nextended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible. In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting\\nevents which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near\\nCardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with\\nGabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the\\nyoung missionary. Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,\\nDagobert said:\\n\\n\"Aye, indeed! \"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!\" exclaimed the blacksmith, with\\nrenewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest\\nheld out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears. \"Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!\" added Dagobert; \"who has\\nwounded you thus?\" and in his turn, taking the other hand of the\\nmissionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of\\nwounds, and then added, \"In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken\\ndown alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon\\nwhich the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and\\nagony. Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to\\nthis upon your hand.\" \"It is evident that your hands\\nhave been pierced through! and Agricola became\\ngrievously agitated. \"Do not think about it,\" said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment\\nof modesty. \"Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky\\nMountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when\\nProvidence snatched me from their hands.\" \"Unfortunate youth,\" said Dagobert; \"without arms then? You had not a\\nsufficient escort for your protection?\" \"It is not for such as me to carry arms.\" said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;\\n\"and we are never accompanied by any escort.\" \"Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it\\nthat they did not defend you?\" \"Yes, alone; without even a guide.\" exclaimed Dagobert,\\nscarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own\\nsense of hearing. \"The Christian faith,\" said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, \"cannot be\\nimplanted by force or violence. It is only by the power of persuasion\\nthat the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.\" \"Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in\\nhim, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the\\nblessings it offers to mankind.\" There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which\\nwas uttered with simple and touching pathos. Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism\\nthus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now\\ncontemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration\\nand respect. Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite\\nunconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his\\ntwo friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, \"What ails you?\" exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:\\n\"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to\\nbe about as courageous as any man. \"Thunder, don\\'t you know that the brave wounds there\" (the veteran took\\nwith transport both of Gabriel\\'s hands), \"that these wounds are as\\nglorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by\\nprofession!\" exclaimed Agricola; and he added,\\nwith enthusiasm, \"Oh, for such priests! John put down the apple. How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their\\nresignation!\" \"I entreat you not to extol me thus,\" said Gabriel with embarrassment. When I have\\ngone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone? Was I not under\\nthe eyes of my commanding officer? Were not my comrades there along with\\nme? John travelled to the kitchen. In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self\\npreservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the\\nshouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes\\nof the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,\\nwhich bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail? Daniel went to the bedroom. Need I state\\nthat I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every\\none--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough\\nhide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound. Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game. But are you\\nnot a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,\\nunarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those\\nwhom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by\\nartillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?\" cried Agricola, \"how noble of you to render to\\nGabriel this justice!\" \"Oh, dear brother,\" said Gabriel, \"his kindness to me makes him magnify\\nwhat was quite natural and simple!\" said the veteran soldier; \"yes, natural for gallants who have\\nhearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.\" \"Oh, yes, very rare,\" said Agricola; \"for that kind of courage is the\\nmost admirable of all. Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,\\nalone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity\\nand Christian brotherhood. They seized you, tortured you; and you await\\ndeath and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,\\nwithout hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness\\nissuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and\\nthis in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your\\nmagnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you\\nwere rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black\\nrobe! can you still contend that you are not\\nas brave as he?\" \"And besides, too,\" resumed Dagobert, \"the dear boy did all that for a\\nthankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never\\nchange his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!\" \"I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be,\" said Gabriel to\\nDagobert, smiling meekly. \"If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense\\nawaits me on high.\" \"As to all that, my boy,\" said Dagobert, \"I do not understand it; and I\\nwill not argue about it. Mary moved to the kitchen. I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would\\nbe at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.\" \"But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like\\nGabriel,\" said Agricola, \"and if you did know, dear father, how much\\nvirtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood\\ninsolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind\\ndevotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who\\nare inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly\\nlawnsleeves! Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their\\nvocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand\\nenfranchisement! Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we\\nare, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us. You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your\\nambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you\\nunderstand the good that you could work within it.\" \"My desire is still the same,\" said Gabriel sadly: \"but unfortunately--\"\\nand then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change\\nthe conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: \"Believe me:\\nbe more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine. Your\\ncourage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the\\nspectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling\\nheart. We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill.\" At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,\\nlooked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, \"This is most\\nsurprising!\" \"What Gabriel has just told us,\" replied Dagobert, \"brings to my mind\\nwhat I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I\\nadvanced in years. Listen, my children: more than once, on the night\\nafter a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by\\nnight,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our\\npossession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of\\nthe slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of\\nmy old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has\\nrestored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious\\nwhirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,\\n\\'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?\\' But this\\nfeeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following\\nmorning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once\\nmore to the slaughter. But the same thought always recurred when my arm\\nbecame weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my\\nhorse, I have said to myself, \\'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!! The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old\\nsoldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past. said Gabriel to him, \"all generous hearts feel as you did during\\nthe solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man\\nis left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his\\nbosom.\" \"And that should prove, my brave boy,\" rejoined Dagobert, \"that you are\\ngreatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have\\nnever abandoned you. * * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the\\nclaws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?\" At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,\\nthat the soldier said to him: \"If you ought not or cannot answer my\\nrequest, let us say no more about it.\" \"I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother,\" replied\\nthe missionary with altered voice. \"Only; it will be difficult for me to\\nmake you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.\" \"Surely,\" said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, \"I must have been deceived\\nby a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I\\nawaited death with resignation. My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must\\nhave been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has\\nremained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I\\nshould have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--\"\\n\\nDagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he\\nalso had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had\\nfreed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic. \"Of her who saved me,\" was the reply. \"A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?\" \"Yes,\" replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, \"a woman,\\nyoung and beautiful!\" When I asked her, she replied, \\'I am the sister of the\\ndistressed!\\'\" asked Dagobert, singularly\\ninterested. \"\\'I go wheresoever there is suffering,\\' she replied,\" answered\\nthe missionary; \"and she departed, going towards the north of\\nAmerica--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,\\nwhere the nights are without end.\" \"As in Siberia,\" said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful. \"But,\" resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also\\nto have become more and more absorbed, \"in what manner or by what means\\ndid this woman come to your assistance?\" The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was\\nheard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the\\nfears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted\\nbrother. \"Agricola,\" said a sweet voice outside the door, \"I wish to\\nspeak with you as soon as possible.\" The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch\\'s voice, and opened the door. But\\nthe young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark\\npassage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: \"Agricola, it is an hour\\nsince broad day, and you have not yet departed! I have\\nbeen watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing\\nalarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you. Hasten, I conjure\\nyou, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville. \"Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone. But\\nI could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him.\" said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been\\nstated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola. \"Yes,\" answered Agricola, \"for half an hour he has been with my father\\nand me.\" \"What happiness I shall have in seeing him again,\" said the sewing-girl. John journeyed to the garden. \"He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your\\nmother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young\\nladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep. Your mother\\nhas requested me to give you this letter for your father. \"Well,\" resumed Mother Bunch, \"now that you have seen Gabriel, do not\\ndelay long. Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came\\nto arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!\" \"You are right,\" said Agricola; \"it is indispensable that I should\\ndepart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were\\nforgotten.\" \"Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,\\nperhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to\\nyourself and us.\" a very few minutes more; and I\\'ll come down.\" I\\'ll come up\\nagain to apprise you. Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,\\nto resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his\\ngarret. Sandra went to the hallway. \"Dear father,\" he said to Dagobert, \"my mother has just received\\nthis letter, and she requests you to read it.\" \"Very well; read it for me, my boy.\" And Agricola read as follows:\\n\\n\"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon\\nwith an affair of very great importance. Will you, as soon as your\\nhusband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres\\nwithout a moment\\'s delay. I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to\\nno other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General\\nSimon. \"DURAND, Notary at Chartres.\" Sandra moved to the hallway. Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, \"Who can\\nhave told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?\" \"Perhaps, father,\" said Agricola, \"this is the notary to whom you\\ntransmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.\" \"But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address\\nwas Paris, not Chartres. And, besides,\" said the soldier, thoughtfully,\\n\"if he has some important documents, why didn\\'t he transmit them to me?\" \"It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as\\npossible,\" said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would\\nwithdraw his father for about two days, during which time his\\n(Agricola\\'s) fate would be decided in one way or other. \"Your counsel is good,\" replied his father. \"This thwarts your intentions in some degree?\" \"Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you. Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it\\nis not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is\\nrequired on an affair of importance. In twice twenty-four hours I shall\\nbe back again. But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for\\nChartres to-day. Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and\\nGabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them\\ncompany.\" \"That is, unfortunately, impossible,\" said the missionary, sadly. \"This\\nvisit on my arrival is also a farewell visit.\" exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once. said Dagobert; \"surely it is not\\npossible?\" \"I must answer no question upon this subject,\" said Gabriel, suppressing\\na sigh: \"but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again\\ninto this house.\" \"Why, my brave boy,\" resumed Dagobert with emotion, \"there is something\\nin thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression. He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the\\nshipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you\\nenrolled under such a commander.\" exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of\\nthe name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; \"was it in\\nCardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?\" \"Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?\" \"Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?\" \"No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return\\nthanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the\\nperson to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.\" \"What a singular coincidence,\" thought Agricola, \"if the young lady\\nshould be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!\" This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made\\nto Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; \"Dear father, excuse me; but it is\\nalready late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o\\'clock.\" Mary journeyed to the garden. Sandra went back to the hallway. This party is adjourned till my\\nreturn from Chartres. Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself.\" Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the\\nlatter had continued pensive. At the moment when Agricola approached him\\nto shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him\\nsolemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished\\nboth the blacksmith and the soldier: \"My dear brother, one word more. I\\nhave come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall\\nhave need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),\"\\nadded Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert. exclaimed Agricola; \"what is the matter?\" \"Yes,\" replied Gabriel, \"I need the advice and assistance of two men of\\nhonor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I\\nnot? At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will\\nyou come?\" Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the\\naccents of the missionary. Agricola felt an oppression of the heart. If\\nhe should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,\\nwhat could be done? \"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon\\nus,\" said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--\"You have a father\\nand a brother; make your own use of them.\" \"Thanks, thanks,\" said Gabriel, \"you set me quite at ease.\" \"I\\'ll tell you what,\" resumed the soldier, \"were it not for your priest\\'s\\nrobe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,\\nthat you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.\" \"Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and\\nfearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A\\nFATHER and A BROTHER!\" Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually\\nincreasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de\\nCardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader. Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,\\nin Paris. Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing\\nthan the aspect of this old mansion. Several immense windows, filled with\\nsmall squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre\\neffect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which\\nthe fabric was composed. This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected\\nin the same quarter towards the middle of the last century. It was\\nsurmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which\\nwas reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps. One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which\\nan arcade led to the vast interior departments. The other front\\noverlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,\\non this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,\\nformed a couple of lateral galleries. Like nearly all the other great\\nhabitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the\\ngarden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion. This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a\\nrotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its\\nerection. It presented, in every part where it was possible for the\\nstones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of\\nflowers, and chubby cupids. Daniel moved to the office. This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de\\nCardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a\\nperistyle of several steps. A small vestibule led to a circular hall,\\nlighted from the roof. Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of\\nsmaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes. These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or\\ntransformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,\\nthe black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the\\nentire structure repaired. Daniel went to the kitchen. The white stones of which it was built\\nglistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect\\ncontrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity\\nof an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic\\nclumps of verdant trees. The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following\\nthat of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in\\nthe Rue Brise-Miche. The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a\\nneighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue\\nsky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of\\nverdure over the summer-house. The door in the vestibule opened, and the\\nrays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon\\ntwo charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place\\nin the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its\\nown, which was very striking. In plain terms two individuals, one of them\\na young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that\\nbreed of spaniels called King Charles\\'s, made their appearance under the\\nperistyle of the rotunda. Sandra moved to the bathroom. The name of the young girl was Georgette; the\\nbeautiful little spaniel\\'s was Frisky. Georgette was in her eighteenth\\nyear. Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady\\'s maid of Marivaux, a\\nmore mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth\\nmore white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or\\nform smarter, attractive, and enticing. Though it was yet very early,\\nGeorgette was carefully and tastefully dressed. A tiny Valenciennes cap,\\nwith flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with\\nrose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful\\nfair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray\\nlevantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large\\ntuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a\\nhollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,\\nsurmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and\\nflexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,\\nallowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,\\nreaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold. When\\nGeorgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more\\nquickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky\\'s indifferent eyes a beautiful\\nankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in\\nwhite silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish\\nsatin. When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when\\nvivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a\\njoyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless\\nfor the conquest of everything before her than a brunette. This bewitching and nimble lady\\'s-maid, who on the previous evening had\\nintroduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the\\nHonorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint\\nDizier. Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak\\nbut joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf. She was\\nnot much bigger than one\\'s fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,\\nshone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her\\nneck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery\\ntan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her\\nlarge eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that\\nthey trailed upon the ground. Georgette seemed to be as brisk and\\npetulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after\\nthe happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon\\nthe greensward in her turn. John moved to the garden. All at once, at the sight of a second person,\\nwho advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly\\nstopped in their diversion. The little King Charles, some steps in\\nadvance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held\\nherself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up\\nof the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,\\nthough of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp. The enemy\\nconsisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the\\ncolor of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was\\npot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;\\nhe walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air\\nof a doctor. His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs\\nsallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and\\naltogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive. This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a\\n\"church-goer\\'s pug,\" answered to the name of \"My Lord.\" Mary went back to the bathroom. His mistress, a\\nwoman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was\\ndressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay\\nand showy. It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat\\nof the same dye. The features of this woman might have been agreeable in\\nher youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,\\nwhich were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and\\naustere physiognomy which she tried to assume. This matron, of slow and\\ndiscreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess\\nSaint-Dizier. Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two\\nwomen present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even\\nto the animals which attended them. There were similar differences\\nbetween Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs. When\\nthe latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a\\nmovement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the\\nyoung lady\\'s maid. Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the\\napparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,\\nand even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the\\ncur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of\\ndistress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs. Grivois, who bitterly\\nsaid to Georgette:\\n\\n\"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog\\nthus, and setting him upon mine.\" \"It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly\\nanimal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky\\nyesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate. But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,\\nand brought her back to my mistress. However,\" continued Georgette, \"to\\nwhat, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?\" \"I am commanded by the Princess,\" replied Mrs. Grivois, unable to conceal\\na smile of triumphant satisfaction, \"immediately to see Miss Adrienne. It\\nregards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to\\nherself.\" Daniel put down the football. At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight\\nstart of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied\\nwith watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl\\nat with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome\\nher temporary emotion, firmly answered: \"Miss Adrienne went to rest very\\nlate last night. She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid\\nday.\" \"That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order\\nof the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken\\nyour mistress immediately.\" \"My mistress is subject to no one\\'s orders in her own house; and I will\\nnot disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands,\" replied\\nGeorgette. \"Then I shall go myself,\" said Mrs. \"Florine and Hebe will not admit you. Indeed, here is the key of the\\nsaloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne\\nbe entered.\" do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the\\nPrincess?\" \"Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my\\nmistress!\" John journeyed to the office. such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her\\nniece,\" said the matron, with affected grief: \"Miss Adrienne no longer\\nrespects her aunt\\'s orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained\\npersons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if\\nfor ball-going.\" how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest\\ncoquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess\\'s women. At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having\\nbeen handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even\\nunto ours!\" do you mean to insinuate that I am a\\nhundred years old, Miss Impertinence?\" \"I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the\\nutmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess\\'s house, who has\\ntoo many tempers for the poor girls!\" \"I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought\\nnot to pronounce but on their knees.\" \"However,\" said Georgette, \"if one wished to speak ill of--\"\\n\\n\"Do you dare!\" \"No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o\\'clock--\"\\n\\n\"Last night?\" \"A four-wheeler,\" continued Georgette, \"stopped at a few paces from the\\nhouse. A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,\\nand directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter\\'s\\nlodge window; and at one o\\'clock in the morning, the cab was still\\nstationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the\\ncloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing\\nthe name of her Highness the Princess on his knees.\" Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the\\nPrincess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the\\nmiddle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris\\nof General Simon\\'s daughters; or whether Mrs. Grivois thought it\\nnecessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her\\nshoulders disdainfully',\n",

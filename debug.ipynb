Crisp (born 1972) is a British theologian who currently works as Professor of Analytic Theology at the University of St. Andrews, and was formerly a professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.  Crisp was, until 2011, a reader in divinity at Bristol University in the United Kingdom. He specializes in analytic theology, philosophical theology, and historical theology. His historical work focuses on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American Reformed theologians, including Jonathan Edwards and William Shedd. His constructive work has, to date, primarily been in the areas of Christology and hamartiology. Along with Michael Rea, Crisp has been involved in a rising trend among growing number of theologians known as analytic theology. As part of this ongoing initiative Crisp and Rea founded the Journal of Analytic Theology (JAT) in 2013.  Simultaneously, Crisp has worked with Fred Sanders to start the L.A. Theology Conference (LATC) in 2013. The conference is in its sixth year as of 2018. He also has an appointment as a professorial fellow at the Logos Centre for Analytic and Exegetical Theology at the University of St Andrews.\\n\\nOliver Crisp earned his Bachelor's degree and Masters of Theology from the University of Aberdeen. He received his Ph.D from the University of London in 2003.  His thesis focused on the philosophical theology of Jonathan Edwards, and was supervised by Paul Helm. In 2017, Crisp was awarded the DLitt degree from the University of Aberdeen.\\n\\nHe is the author or editor of seven books and has written numerous articles in theology.  The covers of Crisp's singly authored works often feature his own artwork. (See for example the cover of Deviant Calvinism) .\\n\\nCrisp is an Evangelical and Reformed Calvinist Christian and attends a Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) church.\\n\\nWorks\\n\\nBooks\\nSaving Calvinism: Expanding the Reformed Tradition by Oliver D.
